Full of people trying to go somewhere. Amongst the hustle and bustle, two large cages rattle on top of two laden trolleys. They’re being
  pushed by two boys, <span class="sc">JAMES POTTER</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS POTTER</span>, their mother, <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, follows after. A thirty-seven-year-old man,
  <span class="sc">HARRY</span>, has his daughter, <span class="sc">LILY</span>, on his shoulders.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad. He keeps saying it.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> James, give it a rest.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">JAMES:</span> I only said he might be in Slytherin. And he might so . . . <em>(Off his dad’s glare.)</em> Fine.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(looking up at his mum)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You’ll write to me, won’t you?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Every day if you want us to.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No. Not every day. James says most people only get letters from home about once a month. I don’t want to . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> We wrote to your brother three times a week last year.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What? James!</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks accusingly at <span class="sc">JAMES</span>.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Yes. You may not want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts. He likes a laugh, your brother.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">JAMES</span> <em>(with a grin)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Can we go now, please?</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at his dad, and then his mum.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> All you have to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms nine and ten.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LILY:</span> I’m so excited.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best to do it at a run if you’re
  nervous.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’m ready.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> and <span class="sc">LILY</span> put their hands on <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s trolley — <span class="sc">GINNY</span> joins
