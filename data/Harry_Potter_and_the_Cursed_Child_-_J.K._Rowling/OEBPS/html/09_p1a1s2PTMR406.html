  without you, you should leap on . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LILY:</span> I’m going to chase the train out.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Lily, come straight back.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Rose.

And how early she
  can take her O.W.L.s.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> I have no idea where she gets her ambition from.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> And how would you feel, Harry, if Al — if he is?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> You know, Gin, we always thought there was a chance you could be sorted into Slytherin.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Honestly, Fred and George ran a book.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Can we go? People are looking, you know.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> People always look when you three are together. And apart. People always look at you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The four exit. <span class="sc">GINNY</span> stops <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Harry . . .
