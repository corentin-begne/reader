Pumpkin Pasty? Chocolate Frog? Cauldron Cake?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE</span> <em>(spotting <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s loving look at the Chocolate Frogs)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Al. We need to
  concentrate.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Concentrate on what?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> On who we choose to be friends with. My mum and dad met your dad on their first Hogwarts Express, you know . . .</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So we need to choose now who to be friends with for life? That’s quite scary.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> On the contrary, it’s exciting. I’m a Granger-Weasley, you’re a Potter — everyone will want to be friends with us,
  we’ve got the pick of anyone we want.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So how do we decide — which compartment to go in . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> We rate them all and then we make a decision.</p>   <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> opens a door — to look in on a lonely blond kid — <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> — in an otherwise empty compartment.
  <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> smiles. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> smiles back.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Hi. Is this compartment . . .</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> It’s free. It’s just me.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Great. So we might just — come in — for a bit — if that’s okay?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That’s okay. Hi.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Albus. Al. I’m — my name is Albus . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Hi Scorpius. I mean, I’m Scorpius. You’re Albus. I’m Scorpius. And you must be . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span>’s face is growing colder by the minute.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Rose.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Hi, Rose. Would you like some of my Fizzing Whizbees?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> I’ve just had breakfast, thanks.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I’ve also got some Shock-o-Choc, Pepper Imps, and some Jelly Slugs. Mum’s idea — she says <em>(sings)</em>, “Sweets,
  they always help you make friends.” <em>(He realizes that singing was a mistake.)</em> Stupid idea, probably.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’ll have some . . . Mum doesn’t let me have sweets. Which one would you start with?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span> hits <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> out of sight of <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Easy. I’ve always regarded the Pepper Imp as the king of the confectionery bag. They’re peppermint sweets that make you smoke at
  the ears.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Brilliant, then that’s what I’ll — <em>(<span class="sc">ROSE</span> hits him again.)</em> Rose, will you please stop hitting
  me?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> I’m not hitting you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You <em>are</em> hitting me, and it hurts.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s face falls.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> She’s hitting you because of me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Listen, I know who you are, so it’s probably only fair you know who I am.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What do you mean you know who I am?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re Albus Potter. She’s Rose Granger-Weasley. And I am Scorpius Malfoy. My parents are Astoria and Draco Malfoy. Our parents
  — they didn’t get on.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> That’s putting it mildly. Your mum and dad are Death Eaters!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(affronted)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Dad was — but Mum wasn’t.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span> looks away, and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> knows why she does.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">I know what the rumor is, and it’s a lie.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks from an uncomfortable <span class="sc">ROSE</span> to a desperate <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What — is the rumor?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The <em>rumor</em> is that my parents couldn’t have children. That my father and my grandfather were so desperate for a powerful heir, to
  prevent the end of the Malfoy line, that they . . . that they used a Time-Turner to send my mother back . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> To send her back where?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> The rumor is that he’s Voldemort’s son, Albus.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A horrible, uncomfortable silence.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">It’s probably rubbish. I mean . . . look, you’ve got a nose.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The tension is slightly broken. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> laughs, pathetically grateful.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And it’s just like my father’s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that’s a great thing either. I mean
  — father-son issues, I have them. But, on the whole, I’d rather be a Malfoy than, you know, the son of the Dark Lord.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> look at each other and something passes between them.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Yes, well, we probably should sit somewhere else. Come on, Albus.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> is thinking deeply.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No. <em>(Off <span class="sc">ROSE</span>’s look.)</em> I’m okay. You go on . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Albus. I won’t wait.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And I wouldn’t expect you to. But I’m staying here.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span> looks at him a second and then leaves the compartment.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Fine!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> are left — looking at each other — unsure.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Thank you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No. No. I didn’t stay — for you — I stayed for your sweets.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> She’s quite fierce.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes. Sorry.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. I like it. Do you prefer Albus or Al?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> grins and pops two sweets into his mouth.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(thinks)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Albus.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(as smoke comes out of his ears)</em><span class="sc">:</span> THANK YOU FOR STAYING FOR MY SWEETS, ALBUS!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(laughing)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Wow.</p></body></html>
