She is slowly sorting through it all.
  <span class="sc">HARRY</span> enters in a rush. He is bleeding from a graze on his cheek.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak3"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> How did it go?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It was true.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Theodore Nott?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> In custody.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And the Time-Turner itself?</p>       <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> reveals the Time-Turner. It shines out alluringly.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">Is it genuine? Does it work? It’s not just an hour-reversal turner — it goes back further?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> We don’t know anything yet. I wanted to try it out there and then but wiser heads prevailed.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Well, now we have it.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And you’re sure you want to keep it?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I don’t think we’ve a choice. Look at it. It’s entirely different to the Time-Turner I had.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(dry)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Apparently wizardry has moved on since we were kids.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> You’re bleeding.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> checks his face in the mirror.

  paperwork.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Ah. Turns out I’m not.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> No. You’re not. Harry, how can you get any work done in this chaos?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> waves his wand and the papers and books transform into neat piles. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> smiles.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No longer chaotic.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> But still ignored. You know, there’s some interesting stuff in here . . . There are mountain trolls riding Graphorns
  through Hungary, there are giants with winged tattoos on their backs walking through the Greek Seas, and the werewolves have gone entirely underground —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Great, let’s get out there. I’ll get the team together.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Harry, I get it. Paperwork’s boring . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Not for you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’m busy enough with my own. These are people and beasts that fought alongside Voldemort in the great wizarding wars. These are allies
  of darkness. This — combined with what we have just unearthed at Theodore Nott’s — could mean something. But if the Head of Magical Law Enforcement isn’t reading his files
  —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> But I don’t need to read it — I’m out there, hearing about it. Theodore Nott — it was me who heard the rumors about the
  Time-Turner and me who acted upon it. You really don’t need to tell me off.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> looks at <span class="sc">HARRY</span> — this is tricky.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Do you fancy a toffee? Don’t tell Ron.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You’re changing the subject.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I truly am. Toffee?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Can’t. We’re off sugar at the moment. <em>(Beat.)</em> You know, you can get addicted to that stuff?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> What can I say? My parents were dentists, I was bound to rebel at some point. Forty is leaving it a little late, but . . .
  You’ve just done a brilliant thing. You’re certainly not being told off — I just need you to look at your paperwork every now and again, that’s all. Consider this a gentle
  — nudge — from <em>the Minister for Magic</em>.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> hears the implication in her emphasis, he nods.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">How’s Ginny? How’s Albus?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It seems I’m as good at fatherhood as I am at paperwork. How’s Rose? How’s Hugo?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(with a grin)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You know, Ron says he thinks I see more of my secretary, Ethel, <em>(she indicates off)</em> than
  him. Do you think there’s a point where we made a choice — parent of the year or Ministry official of the year? Go on. Go home to your family, Harry, the Hogwarts Express is about to
  depart for another year — enjoy the time you’ve got left — and then come back here with a fresh head and get these files read.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You really think this could all mean something?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(with a smile)</em><span class="sc">:</span> It could do. But if it does, we’ll find a way to fight it, Harry. We always have.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She smiles once more, pops a toffee in her mouth, and leaves the office. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is left alone. He packs his bag. He walks out of the office and down
  a corridor. The weight of the world upon his shoulders.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He walks, tired, into a telephone box. He dials 62442.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TELEPHONE BOX:</span> Farewell, Harry Potter.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He ascends away from the Ministry of Magic.</em></p></body></html>
