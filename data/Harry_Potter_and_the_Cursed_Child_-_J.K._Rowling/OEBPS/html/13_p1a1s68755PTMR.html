He is sitting at the top of the stairs. He hears voices below him. We hear <span class="sc">HARRY</span>’s voice
  before he’s revealed. An elderly man in a wheelchair is with him, <span class="sc">AMOS DIGGORY</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak3"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Amos, I understand, I really do — but I’m only just home and —</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> I’ve tried to make appointments at the Ministry. They say, “Ah, Mr. Diggory, we have an appointment for you, let’s see, in two
  months.” I wait. Very patiently.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> —and coming to my house in the middle of the night — when my kids are just getting ready for their new year at school —
  it’s not right.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Two months pass, I receive an owl, “Mr. Diggory, I’m awfully sorry, but Mr. Potter has been called away on urgent business,
  we’re going to have to shift things around a little, are you available for an appointment in, let’s see, in two months’ time.” And then it repeats again, and
  again . . . You’re shutting me out.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Of course I’m not. It’s just, I’m afraid, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement I’m afraid I’m
  responsible —</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> There’s plenty you’re responsible for.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Sorry?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> My son, Cedric, you do remember Cedric, don’t you?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(remembering Cedric hurts him)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Yes, I remember your son. His loss —</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Voldemort wanted you! Not my son! You told me yourself, the words he said were, “Kill the spare.” The spare. My son, my beautiful
  son, was a spare.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Mr. Diggory, as you know, I sympathize with your efforts to memorialize Cedric, but —</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> A memorial? I am not interested in a memorial — not anymore. I am an old man — an old dying man — and I am here to ask you
  — beg you — to help me get him back.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks up, astonished.</em></p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Get him back? Amos, that’s not possible.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> The Ministry has a Time-Turner, does it not?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> The Time-Turners were all destroyed.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> The reason I’m here with such urgency is I’ve just heard rumor — strong rumor — that the Ministry seized an illegal
  Time-Turner from Theodore Nott and has kept it. For investigation. Let me use that Time-Turner. Let me have my son back.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a long, deadly pause. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is finding this extremely difficult. We watch as <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> moves closer,
  listening.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Amos, playing with time? You know we can’t do that.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> How many people have died for the Boy Who Lived? I’m asking you to save one of them.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>This hurts <span class="sc">HARRY</span>. He thinks, his face hardens.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Whatever you’ve heard, the Theodore Nott story is a fiction, Amos, I’m sorry.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Hello.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> jumps a mile as <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> — a twenty-something, determined-looking woman — is revealed, looking through the
  stairs at him.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Oh. Sorry. Didn’t mean to startle. I used to be a big stair-listener myself. Sitting there. Waiting for someone to say something the tiniest bit interesting.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Who are you? Because this is sort of my house and . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I’m a thief, of course. I’m about to steal everything you own. Give me your gold, your wand, and your Chocolate Frogs! <em>(She
  looks fierce and then smiles.)</em> Either that or I’m Delphini Diggory. <em>(She ascends the stairs and sticks out a hand.)</em> Delphi. I look after him — Amos — well, I try.
  <em>(She indicates <span class="sc">AMOS</span>.)</em> And you are?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(rueful grin)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Albus.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Of course! Albus Potter! So Harry is your dad? That’s a bit wow, isn’t it?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Not really.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Ah. Have I just put my foot in it? It’s what they used to say about me at school. Delphini Diggory — there isn’t a hole she
  couldn’t dig herself into.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> They do all sorts with my name too.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Pause. She looks at him carefully.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Delphi.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She makes to depart and then hesitates. She smiles at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> We don’t choose who we’re related to. Amos . . . isn’t just my patient, he’s my uncle, it’s part
  of the reason I took the job at Upper Flagley. But that’s made it difficult. It’s tough to live with people stuck in the past, isn’t it?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Delphi!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Upper Flagley?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> St. Oswald’s Home for Old Witches and Wizards. Come see us sometime. If you like.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> DELPHI!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She smiles and then trips as she travels down the stairs. She enters the room with <span class="sc">AMOS</span> and <span class="sc">HARRY</span> in it. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> watches her.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Yes, Uncle?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Meet the once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man. I will leave you in peace, sir. If peace is the right word for it. Delphi, my
  chair . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Yes, Uncle.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">AMOS</span> is pushed out of the room. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is left, looking forlorn. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> watches on, thinking
  carefully.</em></p></body></html>
