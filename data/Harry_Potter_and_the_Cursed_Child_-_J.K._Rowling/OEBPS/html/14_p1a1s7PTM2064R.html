Still against the constant motion outside. We hear a roar from <span class="sc">JAMES</span> (off).</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> James, please, ignore your hair, and tidy that damn room . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">JAMES:</span> How can I ignore it? It’s pink! I’m going to have to use my Invisibility Cloak!</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">JAMES</span> appears at the door, he has pink hair.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> That’s <em>not</em> why your dad gave you that Cloak!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LILY:</span> Who’s seen my Potions book?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Lily Potter, don’t think you’re wearing those to school tomorrow . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">LILY</span> appears at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s door. She’s wearing fairy wings that flutter.</em></p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LILY:</span> I love them. They’re fluttery.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>She exits as <span class="sc">HARRY</span> appears in <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s doorway. He looks through.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Hi.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s an awkward pause between them. <span class="sc">GINNY</span> appears in the doorway. She sees what’s happening, she stays a moment.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak2">Just delivering a pre-Hogwarts gift — gifts — Ron’s sent this . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Okay. A love potion. Okay.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I think it’s a joke about — I don’t know what. Lily got farting gnomes, James got a comb that’s made his hair turn a
  shade of pink. Ron — well, Ron’s Ron, you know?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> puts down <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s love potion on his bed.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">I also — this is from me . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>He reveals a small blanket. <span class="sc">GINNY</span> looks at it, she sees <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is trying, and then she softly walks away.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> An old blanket?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I thought a lot about what to give you this year. James — well, James has been going on about the Invisibility Cloak since time itself,
  and Lily — I knew she’d love wings — but you. You’re fourteen years old now, Albus, and I wanted to give you something which — meant something.
  This . . . is the last thing I had from my mum. The only thing. I was given to the Dursleys wrapped in it. I thought it had gone forever and then, when your great-aunt Petunia died,
  hidden amongst her possessions, surprisingly, Dudley found this and he kindly sent it on to me, and ever since then — well, anytime I’ve wanted luck I’ve found it and just tried
  to hold it and I wondered if you . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Wanted to hold it too? Okay. Done. Let’s hope it brings me luck. I certainly need some.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He touches the blanket.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">But you should keep it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I think — believe — Petunia wanted me to have it, that’s why she kept it, and now I want you to have it from me. I
  didn’t really know my mother — but I think she’d have wanted you to have it too. And maybe — I could come find you — and it — on Hallows’ Eve. I’d
  like to be with it on the night they died — and that could be good for the two of us . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Listen, I’ve got quite a lot of packing to do, and you undoubtedly have Ministry work coming out of your ears, so . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus, I want you to have the blanket.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And do what with it? Fairy wings make sense, Dad, invisibility cloaks, they also make sense — but this — really?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> is slightly heartbroken. He looks at his son, desperate to reach out.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Do you want a hand? Packing. I always loved packing. It meant I was leaving Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts. Which
  was . . . well, I know you don’t love it but . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> For you, it’s the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus, please — can we just —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’m not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say — on behalf of wizarding kind — how grateful we are for your heroism.
  Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus, please — you know, I’ve never wanted gratitude.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But right now I’m overflowing with it — it must be the kind gift of this moldy blanket that did it . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Moldy blanket?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What did you think would happen? We’d hug. I’d tell you I always loved you. What? What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(finally losing his temper)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You know what? I’m done with being made responsible for your unhappiness. At
  least you’ve got a dad. Because I didn’t, okay?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And you think that was unlucky? I don’t.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You wish me dead?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No! I just wish you weren’t my dad.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(seeing red)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Well, there are times I wish you weren’t my son.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a silence. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> nods. Pause. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> realizes what he’s said.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">No, I didn’t mean that . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes. You did.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus, you just know how to get under my skin . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You meant it, Dad. And, honestly, I don’t blame you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a horrible pause.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">You should probably leave me alone now.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus, please . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> picks up the blanket and throws it. It collides with <span class="sc">RON</span>’s love potion, which spills all over the blanket and
  the bed, producing a small puff of smoke.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No luck or love for me, then.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> runs out of the room. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> goes after him.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus. Albus . . . Please . . .</p></body></html>
