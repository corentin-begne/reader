Breathing deeply in the night.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak3"><em>He waits a moment. Calming himself. And then he feels intense pain in his forehead. In his scar. Around him, Dark Magic moves.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It’s fine.

Amos lost his son because of me —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> That doesn’t seem particularly fair on yourself . . .</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> — and there’s nothing I can say — nothing I can say to anyone — unless it’s the wrong thing, of
  course . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> knows what — or rather who — he’s referring to.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> So that’s what’s upsetting you? The night before Hogwarts, it’s never a good night if you don’t want to go. Giving Al
  the blanket. It was a nice try.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It went pretty badly wrong from there. I said some things, Ginny . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I heard.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And you’re still talking to me?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Because I know that when the time is right you’ll say sorry. That you didn’t mean it. That what you said
  concealed . . . other things. You can be honest with him, Harry . . . That’s all he needs.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I just wish he was more like James or Lily.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY</span> <em>(dry)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Yeah, maybe don’t be that honest.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No, I wouldn’t change a thing about him . . . but I can understand them, and . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Albus is different and isn’t that a good thing. And he can tell, you know, when you’re putting on your Harry Potter front. He wants
  to see the real you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> “The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.”</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> looks at him, surprised.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Dumbledore.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> A strange thing to say to a child.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Not when you believe that child will have to die to save the world.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> gasps again — and does all he can not to touch his forehead.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry. What’s wrong?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Fine. I’m fine. I hear you. I’ll try to be —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Does your scar hurt?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No. No. I’m fine. Now, Nox that and let’s get some sleep.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry.
