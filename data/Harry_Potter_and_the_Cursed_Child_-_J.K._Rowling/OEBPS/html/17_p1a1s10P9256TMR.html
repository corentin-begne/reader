Why?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span> isn’t sure how to phrase what she has to say.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Albus, it’s the start of the fourth year, and so the start of a new year for us. I want to be friends again.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We never were friends.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> That’s harsh! You were my best friend when I was six!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> That was a long time ago.</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em>He makes to walk away. She pulls him into an empty compartment.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Have you heard the rumors? Big Ministry raid a few days ago. Your dad apparently was incredibly brave.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> How do you always know about these things and I don’t?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Apparently he — the wizard they raided — Theodore Nott, I think — had all sorts of artifacts that broke all sorts of laws
  including — and this has got them all gooey — an illegal Time-Turner. And quite a superior one at that.</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">ROSE</span>, everything falling into place.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> A Time-Turner? Dad found a Time-Turner?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Shh! Yes. I know. Great, right?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’re sure.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Entirely.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Now I have to find Scorpius.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>He walks down the train. <span class="sc">ROSE</span> follows, still determined to say her piece.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Albus!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> turns decisively.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Who’s told you that you have to talk to me?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE</span> <em>(sprung)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Okay, maybe your mum owled my dad — but only because she’s worried about you. And I just
  think —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Leave me alone, Rose.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> is sitting in his usual compartment. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> enters first, <span class="sc">ROSE</span> still tailing him.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus! Oh hello, Rose, what do you smell of?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> What do I <em>smell</em> of?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No, I meant it as a nice thing, you smell like a mixture of fresh flowers and fresh — bread.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Albus, I’m here, okay? If you need me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I mean, nice bread, good bread, bread . . . what’s wrong with bread?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span> walks away, shaking her head.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> What’s wrong with bread!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’ve been looking for you everywhere . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And now you’ve found me. Ta-da! I was hardly hiding. You know how I like to — get on early. Stops people staring. Shouting.
  Writing “son of Voldemort” on my trunk. That one never gets old. She really doesn’t like me, does she?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> hugs his friend. With fierceness. They hold for a beat. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> is surprised by this.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Okay. Hello. Um. Have we hugged before? Do we hug?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The two boys awkwardly dislocate.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Just a slightly weird twenty-four hours.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> What’s happened in them?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’ll explain later. We have to get off this train.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s the sound of whistles from off. The train starts moving.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Too late. The train is moving. Hogwarts ahoy!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Then we have to get off a moving train.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH:</span> Anything from the trolley, dears?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> opens a window and makes to climb out.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> A moving magical train.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH:</span> Pumpkin Pasty? Cauldron Cake?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus Severus Potter, get that strange look out of your eye.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> First question. What do you know about the Triwizard Tournament?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(happy)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Ooooh, a quiz! Three schools pick three champions to compete in three tasks for one Cup. What’s
  that got to do with anything?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You really are an enormous geek, you know that?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Ya-huh.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Second question. Why has the Triwizard Tournament not been run in over twenty years?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The last competition included your dad and a boy called Cedric Diggory — they decided to win together but the Cup was a Portkey —
  and they were transported to Voldemort. Cedric was killed. They canceled the competition immediately after.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span>: Good. Third question: Did Cedric need to be killed? Easy question, easy answer: No. The words Voldemort said were “Kill the spare.”
  The spare. He died only because he was with my father and my father couldn’t save him — we can. A mistake has been made and we’re going to right it. We’re going to use a
  Time-Turner. We’re going to bring him back.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, for obvious reasons, I’m not a massive fan of Time-Turners . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> When Amos Diggory asked for the Time-Turner my father denied they even existed. He lied to an old man who just wanted his son back — who
  just loved his son. And he did it because he didn’t care — because he doesn’t care. Everyone talks about all the brave things Dad did. But he made some mistakes too. Some big
  mistakes, in fact. I want to set one of those mistakes right. I want us to save Cedric.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Okay, whatever was holding your brain together seems to have snapped.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’m going to do this, Scorpius. I need to do this. And you know as well as I do, I’ll entirely mess it up if you don’t come
  with me. Come on.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He grins. And then disappears ever up. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> hesitates for a moment. He makes a face. And then hoists himself up and disappears after
  <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p></body></html>
