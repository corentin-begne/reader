  about me, something about you, but —</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> As I calculate it we should be approaching the viaduct soon and then it’ll be a short hike to St. Oswald’s Home for Old Witches and
  Wizards . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The what? The where? Look, I am as excited as you are to be a rebel for the first time in my life — yay — train roof — fun
  — but now — oh.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> sees something he doesn’t want to see.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The water will be an extremely useful backup if our Cushioning Charm doesn’t work.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus. The Trolley Witch.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You want a snack for the journey?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. Albus. The Trolley Witch is coming towards us.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No, she can’t be, we’re on top of the train . . .</p>   <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> points <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> in the right direction, and now he can see the <span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH</span>, who approaches
  nonchalantly, pushing her trolley.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH:</span> Anything from the trolley, dears? Pumpkin Pasty? Chocolate Frog? Cauldron Cake?</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Oh.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH:</span> People don’t know much about me. They buy my Cauldron Cakes — but they never really notice me. I don’t remember the
  last time someone asked my name.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What is your name?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH:</span> I’ve forgotten. All I can tell you is that when the Hogwarts Express first came to be — Ottaline Gambol herself offered me
  this job . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That’s — one hundred and ninety years. You’ve been doing this job for one hundred and ninety years?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH:</span> These hands have made over six million Pumpkin Pasties. I’ve got quite good at them. But what people haven’t noticed about
  my Pumpkin Pasties is how easily they transform into something else . . .</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>She picks up a Pumpkin Pasty. She throws it like a grenade. It explodes.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And you won’t believe what I can do with my Chocolate Frogs. Never — never — have I let anyone off this train before they reached their destination. Some
  have tried — Sirius Black and his cronies, Fred and George Weasley. ALL HAVE FAILED. BECAUSE THIS TRAIN — IT DOESN’T LIKE PEOPLE GETTING OFF IT . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The <span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH</span>’s hands transfigure into very sharp spikes. She smiles.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">So please retake your seats for the remainder of the journey.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You were right, Scorpius. This train is magical.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> At this precise moment in time, I take no pleasure in being right.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But I was also right — about the viaduct — that’s water down there, time to try the Cushioning Charm.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, this is a bad idea.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Is it? <em>(He has a moment’s hesitation, then realizes the time for hesitation has passed.)</em> Too late now. Three. Two. One.
  Molliare!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He incants as he jumps.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus . . . Albus . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks down desperately after his friend. He looks at the approaching <span class="sc">TROLLEY WITCH</span>. Her hair wild. Her spikes particularly spiky.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Well, as fun as you clearly look, I have to go after my friend.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He pinches his nose, he jumps after <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>, incanting as he goes.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Molliare!</p></body></html>
