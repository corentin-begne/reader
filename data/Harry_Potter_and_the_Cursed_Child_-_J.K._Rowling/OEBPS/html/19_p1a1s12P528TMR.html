They rattle and chatter like all true wizards and witches can. Amongst them, <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, <span class="sc">DRACO</span>, and <span class="sc">RON</span>. Above them, on a stage, <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> and <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Order. Order. Do I have to conjure silence? <em>(She pulls silence from the crowd using her wand.)</em> Good. Welcome to this Extraordinary
  General Meeting. I’m so pleased so many of you could make it. The wizarding world has been living in peace now for many years. It’s twenty-two years since we defeated Voldemort at the
  Battle of Hogwarts, and I’m delighted to say there is a new generation being brought up having known only the slightest conflict. Until now. Harry.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Voldemort’s allies have been showing movement for a few months now. We’ve followed trolls making their way across Europe, giants
  starting to cross the seas, and the werewolves — well, I’m distressed to say we lost sight of them some weeks ago. We don’t know where they’re going or who’s
  encouraged them to move — but we are aware they are moving — and we are concerned what it might mean. So we’re asking — if anyone has seen anything? Felt anything? If you
  could raise a wand, we will hear everyone speak. Professor McGonagall — thank you.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> It did look like the potions stores had been interfered with when we returned from summer break, but not a huge amount of
  ingredients were missing, some Boomslang skin and lacewing flies, nothing on the Restricted Register. We put it down to Peeves.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Thank you, Professor. We shall investigate. <em>(She looks around the room.)</em> Nobody else? Fine, and — gravest of all — and
  this hasn’t been the case since Voldemort — Harry’s scar is hurting again.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Voldemort is dead, Voldemort is gone.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Yes, Draco, Voldemort is dead, but these things all lead us to think that there is a possibility that Voldemort — or some trace of
  Voldemort — might be back.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>This gets a reaction.</em></p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Now this is difficult but we have to ask it to rule it out. Those of you with a Dark Mark . . . have you felt anything? Even a
  twinge?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Back to being prejudiced against those with a Dark Mark, are we, Potter?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> No, Draco. Harry is simply trying to —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> You know what this is about? Harry just wants his face back in the newspapers again. We’ve had rumors of Voldemort coming back from the
  <em>Daily Prophet</em> once a year every year —</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> None of those rumors came from me!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Really? Doesn’t your wife edit the <em>Daily Prophet</em>?</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> steps towards him, outraged.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> The sports pages!</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Draco. Harry brought this matter to the attention of the Ministry. And I — as Minister for Magic —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> A vote you only won because you are his friend.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> is held back by <span class="sc">GINNY</span> as he charges at <span class="sc">DRACO</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Do you want a smack in the mouth?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Face it — his celebrity impacts upon you all. And how better to get everyone whispering the Potter name again than with <em>(he does an
  impression of <span class="sc">HARRY</span>)</em> “my scar is hurting, my scar is hurting.” And do you know what this all means — that the gossipmongers once again have an
  opportunity to defame my son with these ridiculous rumors about his parentage.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Draco, no one is saying this has anything to do with Scorpius . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Well, I, for one, think this meeting a sham. And I’m leaving.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He walks out. Others start to disperse after him.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> No. That’s not the way . . . Come back. We need a strategy.</p></body></html>
