  <p class="chaptitle">ST. OSWALD’S HOME FOR OLD WITCHES AND WIZARDS</p>

  <p class="textfirst"><em>This is chaos. This is magic. This is St. Oswald’s Home for Old Witches and Wizards and it is as wonderful as you might hope.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak"><em>Walker frames are conjured into life, knitting wool is enchanted into chaos, and male nurses are made to dance tango.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak"><em>These are people relieved of the burden of having to do magic for a reason — instead these witches and wizards do magic for fun. And what fun they have.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> enter, looking around themselves, amused, and let’s face it, slightly scared.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS and SCORPIUS:</span> Um, excuse me . . . Excuse me. EXCUSE ME!</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Okay, so this place is wild.</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We’re looking for Amos Diggory.</p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em>There is suddenly total silence. Everything is instantly still. And slightly depressed.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">WOOL WOMAN:</span> And what you boys want with that miserable old sod?</p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> appears with a smile.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Albus? Albus! You came? How wonderful! Come and say hello to Amos!</p>
