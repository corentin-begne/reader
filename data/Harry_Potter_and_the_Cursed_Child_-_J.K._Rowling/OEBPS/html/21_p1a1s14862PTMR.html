OSWALD’S HOME FOR OLD WITCHES AND WIZARDS, AMOS’S ROOM</p> <p class="textfirst"><em><span class="sc">AMOS</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> — irritated. <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> watches the three
  of them.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> So let me get this straight. You overhear a conversation — a conversation which was not meant for you to overhear — and you decide
  — without prompting, in fact, without leave — to interfere, and interfere hard, in someone else’s business.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> My father lied to you — I know he did. They do have a Time-Turner.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Of course they do. You can move along now.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What? No. We’re here to help.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Help? What use could a pair of undersized teenagers be for me?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> My father proved you don’t have to be grown-up to change the wizarding world.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> So I should allow you to get involved because you’re a Potter? Relying on your famous name, are you?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> A Potter who is in Slytherin House — yes, I’ve read about you — and who brings a Malfoy with him to visit me — a Malfoy
  who may be a Voldemort? Who’s to say you’re not involved in Dark Magic?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Your information was obvious but the confirmation is useful. Your father did lie. Now leave. The pair of you. And stop wasting my time.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(with power and strength)</em><span class="sc">:</span> No, you need to listen to me, you said it yourself — how much blood is on my
  father’s hands. Let me help you change that. Let me help correct one of his mistakes. Trust me.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS</span> <em>(his voice raised)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Did you not hear me, boy? I see no reason to trust you. So go. Now. Before I <em>make</em> you
  leave.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em>He raises his wand ominously. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at the wand — he deflates — <span class="sc">AMOS</span> has crushed him.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Come on, mate, if there’s one thing we’re good at it’s knowing where we’re not wanted.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> is reluctant to leave. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> pulls him by the arm. He turns and they walk away.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I can think of one reason why you should trust them, Uncle.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>They stop.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">They’re the only ones volunteering to help. They’re prepared to bravely put themselves at risk to return your son to your side. In fact, I’m pretty sure they
  put themselves at risk even getting here . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> This is Cedric we’re talking about . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> And — didn’t you say yourself, having someone inside Hogwarts might be a <em>massive</em> advantage?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> kisses the top of <span class="sc">AMOS</span>’s head. <span class="sc">AMOS</span> looks at <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>, and then

What’s in it for you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know what it is to be the spare. Your son didn’t deserve to be killed, Mr. Diggory. We can help you get him back.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS</span> <em>(finally showing emotion)</em><span class="sc">:</span> My son — my son was the best thing that ever happened to me — and
  you’re right, it was an injustice — a gross injustice. If you’re serious . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We’re deadly serious.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> This is going to be dangerous.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We know.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Do we?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> Delphi — perhaps if you were prepared to accompany them?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> If that would make you happy, Uncle.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She smiles at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>, he smiles back.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS:</span> You do understand even getting the Time-Turner will risk your lives.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We’re ready to put our lives at risk.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Are we?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AMOS</span> <em>(gravely)</em><span class="sc">:</span> I hope you have it in you.</p></body></html>
