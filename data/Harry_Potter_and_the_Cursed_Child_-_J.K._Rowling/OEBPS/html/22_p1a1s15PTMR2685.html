The rumors aren’t coming from
  us.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I wrote to him — after he lost Astoria — to ask if there’s anything we could do. I thought maybe — as he was such a good
  friend to Albus — maybe Scorpius might want to stay over part of the Christmas break or . . . My owl came back with a letter containing one simple sentence: “Tell your
  husband to refute these allegations about my son once and for all.”</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> He’s obsessed.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> He’s a mess — a grieving mess.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> And I’m sorry for his loss but when he accuses Hermione of . . . Well . . . <em>(He looks across at
  <span class="sc">HARRY.</span>)</em> Oi droopy drawers, like I say to her all the time, it could be nothing.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Her?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> The trolls could be going to a party, the giants to a wedding, you could be getting bad dreams because you’re worried about Albus, and your
  scar could be hurting because you’re getting old.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Getting old? Thanks, mate.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Honestly, every time I sit down now I make an “ooof” noise. An “ooof.” And my feet — the trouble I’m having
  with my feet — I could write songs about the pain my feet give me — maybe your scar is like that.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> You talk a lot of rubbish.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> I consider it my speciality. That and my range of Skiving Snackboxes. And my love for all of you. Even Skinny Ginny.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> If you don’t behave, Ronald Weasley, I will tell Mum.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> You wouldn’t.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> If some part of Voldemort survived, in whatever form, we need to be prepared. And I’m scared.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I’m scared too.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Nothing scares me. Apart from Mum.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I mean it, Harry, I will not be Cornelius Fudge on this one. I will not stick my head in the sand. And I don’t care how unpopular that
  makes me with Draco Malfoy.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> You never really were one for popularity, were you?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> shoots <span class="sc">RON</span> a withering look as she aims to hit him but <span class="sc">RON</span> jumps out of the way.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Missed.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> hits <span class="sc">RON</span>. <span class="sc">RON</span> winces.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Hit. A very solid hit.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly an owl is in the room.
