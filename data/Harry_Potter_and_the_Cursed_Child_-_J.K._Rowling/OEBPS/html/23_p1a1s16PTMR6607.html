Thanks to Delphi’s
  brilliant preparation work, we are going to take this potion and be transformed, and thus disguised we will be able to enter the Ministry of Magic.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Okay, two points, one, is it painful?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Very — as I understand it.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Thank you. Good to know. Second point: Do either of you know what Polyjuice tastes of? Because I’ve heard it tastes of fish and if it
  does I will just vomit it back up. Fish doesn’t agree with me. Never has. Never will.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Consider us warned. <em>(She knocks back the potion.)</em> It doesn’t taste of fish. <em>(She begins to transform. It’s
  agonizing.)</em> Actually it tastes quite pleasant, yum. It is painful but . . . <em>(She burps, loudly.)</em> Take it back. There is a — slight — <em>(She burps again, she
  turns into <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span>.)</em> Slight — overpowering — fishy residue.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Okay, that’s — wow.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Double wow.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI/HERMIONE:</span> This really doesn’t feel how I — I even sound like her! Triple wow.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Right. Me next.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. No way, José.

  together.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Three. Two. One.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>They swallow.</em></p>         <p class="textbreak2">No, that’s good. <em>(He’s racked with pain.)</em> That’s less good.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>They both start to transform and it’s agonizing.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> turns into <span class="sc">RON</span>, <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> into <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>The two look at each other.
