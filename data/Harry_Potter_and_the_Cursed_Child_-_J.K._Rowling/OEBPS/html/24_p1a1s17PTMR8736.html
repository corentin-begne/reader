She keeps talking about letting down Ottaline Gambol. She prides herself on her Hogwarts delivery record.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Have there been any instances of magic reported by the Muggles?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> None so far. I have made the Muggle Prime Minister aware and he is filing what is known as a misper. Sounds like a spell. It isn’t.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> So now we’re relying on Muggles to find our children? Have we told them about Harry’s scar too?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We’re merely asking the Muggles to help. And who knows how Harry’s scar might be involved but it’s certainly a matter
  we’re taking seriously. Our Aurors are currently investigating anyone involved in Dark Magic and —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> This is not Death Eater–related.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’m not sure I share your confidence.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> I’m not confident, I’m right. The sort of cretins pursuing Dark Magic now . . . My son is a Malfoy, they
  wouldn’t dare.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Unless there’s something new out there, something to —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I agree with Draco. If this is a kidnap — taking Albus I understand, taking them both . . .</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> locks eyes with <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, it becomes clear what she wants him to say.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> And Scorpius is a follower, not a leader, despite everything I’ve tried to instill in him. So it’s undoubtedly Albus who got him
  from that train and my question is, where would he take him?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry, they’ve run away, you and I know it.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DRACO</span> notices the couple staring at each other.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Do you?
