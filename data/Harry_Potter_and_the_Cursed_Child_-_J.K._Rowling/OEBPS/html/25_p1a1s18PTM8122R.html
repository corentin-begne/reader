  even told us where — the office of the Minister for Magic herself.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>She indicates a door.

Why?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI/HERMIONE:</span> Well, it can’t be either of us, can it? We <em>are</em> them.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(from off)</em><span class="sc">:</span> What you said was obviously wrong — but — there are more factors at play here than

I can’t . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a small kerfuffle and then <span class="sc">ALBUS/RON</span> ends up standing outside the door as <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> and <span class="sc">HARRY</span> enter from off.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Hermione, I’m grateful for your concern but there’s no need —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Surprise!!!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> What are you doing here?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Does a man need an excuse to see his wife?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He kisses <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> firmly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I should go . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Harry. My point is . . . whatever Draco says — the things you said to Albus . . . I don’t think
  it’ll do any of us any good for you to dwell on it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Oh, you’re talking about how Harry said sometimes he wished I — <em>(he corrects himself)</em> Albus weren’t his son.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Better out than in, that’s what I say . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> He’ll know . . .

What then?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron, now’s not the time, honestly.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Of course it isn’t. Bye-bye, darling.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON</span> watches her go, hopeful she’ll walk past her office and away. But of course she doesn’t. He runs to block her before she
  enters through her door.

Blocking. Anything.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She again makes for the door, he blocks her again.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> You are. Let me into my room, Ron.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Let’s have another baby.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> tries to dodge past him.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Or if not another baby, a holiday. I want a baby or a holiday and I’m going to insist on it. Shall we talk about it later, honey?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She tries to get into the room one final time, he blocks her with a kiss. It develops into quite a struggle.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Maybe with a drink in the Leaky Cauldron? Love you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(relenting)</em><span class="sc">:</span> If there is another stink pellet in there then Merlin won’t help you. Fine. We’re due
  to update the Muggles anyway.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She exits. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> exits with her.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON</span> turns towards the door.

Some days you are off the scale, you know that?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> It’s why you married me, isn’t it? My puckish sense of fun.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She exits again. He starts to open the door but again she reenters, he slams it closed.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I can taste fish. I told you to stay away from those fishfinger sandwiches.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS/RON:</span> Right you are.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She exits. He checks she’s gone and the relief floods out of him as he opens the door.</em></p></body></html>
