Harry. These pots aren’t clean. THESE POTS ARE A DISGRACE. HARRY POTTER. Wake up.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY</span> wakes to see <span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA</span> bearing down on him.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> Aunt Petunia. What time is it?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> Time enough. You know, when we agreed to take you in, we hoped we could improve you — build you — make you a decent human
  being. So I suppose it’s only ourselves we’ve got to blame that you’ve turned out . . . such a limp disappointment.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> I try —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> Trying is not succeeding though, is it? There are grease smears on the glasses. There are scuff marks on the pots. Now get up and go to
  the kitchen and get scrubbing.</p>       <p class="textbreak2"><em>He gets out of bed. There’s a wet smear down the back of his trousers.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">Oh no. Oh no. What have you done? You’ve wet the bed, again.</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls back the covers.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">This is very unacceptable.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> I’m — sorry, I think I was having a nightmare.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> You disgusting boy. Only animals wet themselves. Animals and disgusting little boys.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> It was about my mum and dad. I think I saw them — I think I saw them — die?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> And why would I have the slightest bit of interest in that?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> There was a man shouting Adkava Ad-something Acabra — Ad — and the noise of a snake hissing. I could hear my mum scream.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA</span> takes a moment to reset herself.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> If you were really reliving their death, all you’d hear would be a screech of brakes and a horrific thud. Your parents died in a
  car accident. You know that. I don’t think your mother had even time to scream. Lord spare you the details more than that. Now strip those sheets, get in the kitchen, and get scrubbing. I
  don’t want to have to tell you again.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>She exits with a bang.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>And <span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY</span> is left holding the sheets.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And the stage contorts and trees rise as the dream twists into something else entirely.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly, <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> appears and stands looking at <span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then, right from the back of the room, Parseltongue whispers around everyone.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He’s coming. He’s coming.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Words said in an unmistakable voice. The voice of <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span> . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Haaarry Pottttter.</em></p></body></html>
