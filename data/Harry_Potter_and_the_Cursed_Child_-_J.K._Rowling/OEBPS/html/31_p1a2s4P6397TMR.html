You’re good at this.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>She takes her wand back from him.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>(In a posh voice.)</em> “You’re a positively disarming young man.”</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Expelliarmus!</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>Her wand flies back again.</em></p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> And we have a winner.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>The two high-five.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’ve never been good at spells.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> appears at the back of the stage. He looks at his friend talking to a girl — and part of him likes it and part of him
  doesn’t.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I was rubbish — and then something clicked. And it will for you too. Not that I’m a super witch or anything but — I think
  you’re becoming quite some wizard, Albus Potter.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Then you should stick around, teach me more . . .</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Of course I’m sticking around, we’re friends, aren’t we?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes. Yes. Definitely friends. Definitely.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Great. Wizzo!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> What’s wizzo?</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> steps forward decisively.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Cracked the spell. I mean, it’s pretty basic, but I was — well, I cracked it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(over-enthusiastic, trying to join in)</em><span class="sc">:</span> And I’ve found our way through to the school. Listen, are we sure
  this will work . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Yes!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It’s a brilliant plan. The secret to not getting Cedric killed is to stop him winning the Triwizard Tournament. If he doesn’t win,
  he can’t be killed.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And I understand that, but . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So we just need to mess up his chances supremely badly in task one. The first task is getting a golden egg from a dragon, how did Cedric
  distract the dragon —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> puts her hand in the air. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> grins and points at her. These two are getting on really well now.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Diggory.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> — by transfiguring a stone into a dog.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> — well, a little Expelliarmus and he won’t be able to do that.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> isn’t enjoying the <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>-<span class="sc">ALBUS</span> double act.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Okay, two points, first point, we’re certain the dragon won’t kill him?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> It’s always two points with him, isn’t it? Of course it won’t. This is Hogwarts. They won’t let damage happen to any of
  the champions.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Okay, second <em>point —</em> more significant <em>point —</em> we’re going back without any knowledge of whether we can travel
  back afterwards. Which is exciting. Maybe we should just — try going back an hour, say, first and then . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I’m sorry, Scorpius, we’ve no time to waste. Waiting here this close to the school is just too dangerous — I’m sure
  they’ll be looking for you and . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> She’s right.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Now, you’re going to need to wear these.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls out two large paper bags. The boys pull robes from them.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But these are Durmstrang robes.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> My uncle’s idea. If you are in Hogwarts robes people will expect to know who you are. But there are two other schools competing at the
  Triwizard Tournament — and if you’re in Durmstrang robes — well, you can fade into the background, can’t you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Good thinking! Hang on, where are your robes?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Albus, I’m flattered, but I don’t think I can pretend to be a student, do you? I’ll just keep in the background and pretend
  to be a — ooh, maybe I could pretend to be a dragon tamer. You’re doing all the spell stuff anyway.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at her and then at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You shouldn’t come.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re right. We don’t need you for the spell. And if you can’t wear student robes — you’re too big a risk.
  Sorry, Delphi, you shouldn’t come.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> But I have to — he’s my cousin. Albus?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I think he’s right. I’m sorry.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We won’t mess up.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> But without me — you won’t be able to work the Time-Turner.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You taught us how to use the Time-Turner.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> is really upset.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> No. I won’t let you do this . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You told your uncle to trust us. Now it’s your turn. The school is close now. We should leave you here.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> looks at them both and takes a deep breath. She nods to herself and smiles.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Then go. But — just know this . . . Today you get an opportunity few are given — today you get to change history
  — to change time itself. But more than all that, today you get the chance to give an old man his son back.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She smiles. She looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>. She leans down and gently kisses him on both cheeks.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She walks away into the woodland. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> stares after her.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> She didn’t kiss me — did you notice? <em>(He looks at his friend.)</em> Are you okay, Albus? You look a little pale. And red. Pale
  and red at the same time.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Let’s do this.</p></body></html>
