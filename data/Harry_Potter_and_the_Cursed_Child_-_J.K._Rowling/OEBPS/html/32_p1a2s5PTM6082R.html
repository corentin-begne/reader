But slowly people melt away until <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is left alone.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak"><em>He hears something. He turns to his right.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus? Scorpius? Albus?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>And then he hears the sound of hooves. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is startled. He looks around for where the noise is coming from.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly <span class="sc">BANE</span> steps forward into the light. He is a magnificent centaur.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> Harry Potter.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Good. You still recognize me, Bane.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> You’ve grown older.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I have.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> But not wiser. For you trespass on our land.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I have always respected the centaurs. We are not enemies. You fought bravely at the Battle of Hogwarts. And I fought beside you.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> I did my part. But for my herd, and our honor. Not for you. And after the battle, the forest was deemed centaur land. And if you’re on our
  land — without permission — then you are our enemy.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> My son is missing, Bane. I need help finding him.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> And he is here? In our forest?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Yes.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> Then he is as stupid as you are.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Can you help me, Bane?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a pause. <span class="sc">BANE</span> looks down at <span class="sc">HARRY</span> imperiously.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> I can only tell you what I know . . . But I tell you not for your benefit but for the benefit of my herd. The centaurs do not need
  another war.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Neither do we! What do you know?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> I’ve seen your son, Harry Potter.

I can’t tell you how you’ll find him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> But you’ve seen something? You’ve divined something?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> There is a black cloud around your son, a dangerous black cloud.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Around Albus?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">BANE:</span> A black cloud that may endanger us all. You’ll find your son again, Harry Potter. But then you could lose him forever.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He makes a sound like a horse’s cry — and then makes hard away — leaving a bewildered <span class="sc">HARRY</span> behind.

  — now with even more fervor.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus! Albus!</p></body></html>
