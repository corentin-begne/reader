When you see it?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>And revealed through the trees is <span class="sc">HOGWARTS</span> — a splendid mass of bulbous buildings and towers.</em></p>       <p class="textbreak2">From the moment I first heard of it, I was desperate to go. I mean, Dad didn’t much like it there but even the way he described it . . . From the age of
  ten I’d check the <em>Daily Prophet</em> first thing every morning — certain some sort of tragedy would have befallen it — certain I wouldn’t get to go.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And then you got there and it turned out to be terrible after all.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Not for me.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at his friend, shocked.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak2">All I ever wanted to do was go to Hogwarts and have a mate to get up to mayhem with. Just like Harry Potter. And I got his son. How crazily fortunate is that.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But I’m nothing like my dad.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re better. You’re my best friend, Albus. And this is mayhem to the nth degree. Which is great, thumbs-up great, it’s
  just — I have got to say — I don’t mind admitting — I am a tiny bit — just a tiny bit scared.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and smiles.</em></p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’re my best friend too. And don’t worry — I have a good feeling about this.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>We hear <span class="sc">RON</span>’s voice from off — he’s clearly in close proximity.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Albus?

  explodes into a storm of movement.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And with it the stage starts to transform. The two boys look at it.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And there is a giant whoosh of light. A smash of noise.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And time stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards, slow at first . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then it speeds up.</em></p></body></html>
