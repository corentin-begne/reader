  well . . . he’s having a ball.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> Ladies and gentlemen — boys and girls — I give you — the greatest — the fabulous — the one — and the
  only TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p>       <p class="textbreak2">If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p>  <p class="textbreak2">AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a slightly limp cheer.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak2">Slightly less enthusiastic from the French there.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(smiling)</em><span class="sc">:</span> This has worked. That’s Ludo Bagman.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> And there they are. Ladies and gentlemen — boys and girls — I present to you — the reason why we’re all here
  — THE CHAMPIONS. Representing Durmstrang, what eyebrows, what a gait, what a boy, there’s nothing he won’t try on a broomstick, it’s Viktor Krazy Krum.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(who are really getting into playing the Durmstrang students now)</em>: Go, go, Krazy Krum. Go, go, Krazy
  Krum.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> From the Beauxbatons Academy — <em>zut alors</em>, it’s Fleur Delacour!</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s some polite applause.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">And from Hogwarts not one but two students, he makes us all go weaky at the kneesy, he’s Cedric Delicious Diggory.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>The crowd go wild.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak2">And then the other—you know him as the Boy Who Lived, I know him as the boy who keeps surprising us all . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> That’s my dad.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> Yes, it’s Harry Plucky Potter.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s cheering. Particularly from a nervous-looking girl at the edge of the crowd—this is <span class="sc">YOUNG HERMIONE</span> (played by the same actress
  as plays <span class="sc">ROSE</span>). It is noticeable that the cheering for <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is slightly less than that for <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And now — silence please, all. The — first — task. Retrieving a golden egg. From a nest of — ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I give you —
  DRAGONS. And guiding the dragons — CHARLIE WEASLEY.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There are more cheers.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HERMIONE:</span> If you’re going to stand so close I’d rather you didn’t breathe on me quite so much.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Rose? What are you doing here?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HERMIONE:</span> Who’s Rose? And what’s happened to your accent?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(with a bad accent)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Sorry. Hermione. He’s got you mixed up with someone else.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HERMIONE:</span> How do you know my name?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> And with no time to lose let’s bring out our first champion — facing a Swedish Short-Snout, I give you — CEDRIC
  DIGGORY.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A dragon roar distracts <span class="sc">YOUNG HERMIONE</span>, and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> readies his wand.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And Cedric Diggory has entered the stage. And he seems ready. Scared, but ready. He dodges this way. He dodges that. The girls swoon as he dives for cover. They cry as one:
  Don’t damage our Diggory, Mr. Dragon!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks concerned.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, something is going wrong. The Time-Turner, it’s shaking.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A ticking begins, an incessant, dangerous ticking. It’s coming from the Time-Turner.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> And Cedric skirts left and he dives right — and he readies his wand — what has this young, brave, handsome man got up his
  sleevies now —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(extending his wand)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Expelliarmus!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CEDRIC</span>’s wand is summoned to <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s hand.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> — but no, what’s this? Is it Dark Magic or is it something else entirely? His wand is flying away — Cedric Diggory is
  Disarmed —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, I think the Time-Turner — something is wrong . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The Time-Turner’s ticking gets louder still.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> It’s all going wrong for Diggors. This could be the end of the task for him. The end of the tournament.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> grabs <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a crescendo in the ticking, and a flash.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And time is turned back to the present, with <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> hollering in pain.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus! Did it hurt you? Albus, are you —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What happened?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> There must be some limit — the Time-Turner must have some kind of <em>time</em> limit . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Do you think we’ve done it? Do you think we’ve changed anything?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly the stage is invaded from all sides by <span class="sc">HARRY</span>, <span class="sc">RON</span> (who now has a side parting in his hair and whose wardrobe
  choices have become rather more staid), <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, and <span class="sc">DRACO</span>. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at them all — and slips the Time-Turner back
  into his pocket. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at them rather more blankly — he’s in a lot of pain.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> I told you. I told you I saw them.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I think we’re about to find out.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Hello, Dad. Is something wrong?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at his son disbelievingly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Yes. You could say that.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> collapses onto the floor. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> and <span class="sc">GINNY</span> rush to help.</em></p></body></html>
