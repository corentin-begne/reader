Above them is a picture of a concerned kindly man.
  <span class="sc">HARRY</span> rubs his eyes — stands — and walks around the room. He stretches out his back.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak"><em>And then he meets eyes with the painting. Which looks startled to be spotted. And <span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks startled back.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Professor Dumbledore.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Good evening, Harry.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’ve missed you. Whenever I’ve dropped in on the headmistress lately, your frame’s been empty.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Ah, well, I do like to pop into my other portraits now and then. <em>(He looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.)</em> Will he be all
  right?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He’s been out twenty-four hours, mostly in order so Madam Pomfrey could reset his arm. She said it was the strangest thing, it’s
  like it was broken twenty years ago and allowed to set in the “most contrary” of directions. She says he’ll be fine.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> A difficult thing, I imagine, to watch your child in pain.</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks up at <span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE</span>, and then down at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’ve never asked how you felt about me naming him after you, have I?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Candidly, Harry, it seemed a great weight to place upon the poor boy.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I need your help. I need your advice. Bane says Albus is in danger. How do I protect my son, Dumbledore?</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> You ask me, of all people, how to protect a boy in terrible danger? We cannot protect the young from harm. Pain must and will come.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> So I’m supposed to stand and watch?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> No. You’re supposed to teach him how to meet life.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> How? He won’t listen.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Perhaps he’s waiting for you to see him clearly.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> frowns as he tries to digest this.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak2">(<em>With sensitivity.)</em> It is a portrait’s curse and blessing to . . . hear things. At the school, at the Ministry, I hear people
  talking . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And what is the gossip about me and my son?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Not gossip. Concern. That you two are struggling. That he’s difficult. That he is angry with you. I have formed the impression that
  — perhaps — you are blinded by your love for him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Blinded?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> You must see him as he is, Harry. You must look for what’s wounding him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Haven’t I seen him as he is? What’s wounding my son? <em>(He thinks.)</em> Or is it who’s wounding my son?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(mumbles in his sleep)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Dad . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> This black cloud, it’s someone, isn’t it? Not something?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Ah really, what does my opinion matter anymore? I am paint and memory, Harry, paint and memory. And I never had a son.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> But I need your advice.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and then back at <span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE</span>. But <span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE</span> is
  gone.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No, where have you gone now?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We’re in — the hospital wing?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> turns his attention back to <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(discombobulated)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Yes. And you’re — you will be fine. For recuperation, Madam Pomfrey wasn’t
  sure what to prescribe and said you should probably eat lots of — chocolate. Actually, do you mind if I have some — ? I’ve got something to tell you and I don’t think
  you’ll like it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at his dad, what does he have to say? He decides not to engage.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Okay. I think.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> takes some chocolate, he eats a big chunk. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at his dad, confused.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Better?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Much.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He holds out the chocolate to his son. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> takes a piece. Father and son munch together.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">The arm, how does it feel?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> flexes his arm.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It feels great.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(soft)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Where did you go, Albus? I can’t tell you what it did to us. Your mum was worried
  sick . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks up, he is a great liar.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We decided we didn’t want to come to school. We thought we could start again — in the Muggle world. We discovered we were wrong. We
  were coming back to Hogwarts when you found us.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> In Durmstrang robes?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The robes were . . . The whole thing — Scorpius and I — we didn’t think.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And why — why did you run? Because of me? Because of what I said?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I don’t know. Hogwarts isn’t actually that pleasant a place when you don’t fit in.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And did Scorpius — encourage you to — go?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius? No.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>, trying to see almost an aura around him, thinking deeply.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I need you to stay away from Scorpius Malfoy.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What? Scorpius?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I don’t know how you became friends in the first place, but you did, and now — I need you to —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> My best friend? My only friend?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He’s dangerous.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius? Dangerous? Have you met him? Dad, if you honestly think he’s the son of Voldemort . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I don’t know what he is, I just know you need to stay away from him. Bane told me —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Who’s Bane?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> A centaur with profound Divination skills. He said there’s a black cloud around you and —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> A black cloud?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And I have very good reason to believe that Dark Magic is in a resurgence and I need to keep you safe from it. Safe from him. Safe from
  Scorpius.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> hesitates a moment, and then his face strengthens.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And if I won’t? Stay away from him?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at his son, thinking quickly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> There’s a map. It used to be used for those wanting to get up to no good. Now we’re going to use it to keep an eye — a
  permanent eye — on you. Professor McGonagall will watch your every movement. Any time you are seen together — she’ll come flying — any time you attempt to leave Hogwarts
  — she’ll fly. I expect you to go to your lessons — none of which you will now share with Scorpius, and between times, you will stay in the Gryffindor common room!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You can’t make me go into Gryffindor! I’m Slytherin!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Don’t play games, Albus, you know what House you are. If she finds you with Scorpius, I will fix you with a spell which will allow me eyes
  and ears into your every movement, your every conversation. In the meantime, investigations will begin in my department as to his true heritage.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(starting to cry)</em><span class="sc">:</span> But, Dad — you can’t — that’s just not . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I thought for a long time I wasn’t a good enough dad for you because you didn’t like me. It’s only now I realize that I
  don’t need you to like me, I need you to obey me because I’m your dad and I do know better. I’m sorry, Albus. It has to be this way.</p></body></html>
