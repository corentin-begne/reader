If ever we needed one of your jokes it’s now . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> frowns, confused.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Jokes? I don’t know any jokes.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Of course you do. You run a joke shop.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON</span> <em>(now supremely confused)</em><span class="sc">:</span> A joke shop? Well now. Anyway I’m pleased I caught you. I was going to bring some
  sweets — for a, uh, sort of, a, get well soon, but, uh . . . Actually Padma — she thinks about things a lot more — deeply — than I do — and she thought
  it’d be nicer for you to get something useful for school. So we got you a — set of quills. Yes. Yes. Yes. Look at these bad boys. Top of the range.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Who’s Padma?</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> frowns at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Your aunt.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I have an Aunt Padma?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON</span> <em>(to <span class="sc">HARRY</span>)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Taken a Confundus Charm to the head, has he? <em>(To <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.)</em> My wife, Padma. You remember. Talks slightly too close to your face, smells a bit minty. <em>(Leans in.)</em> Padma, mother of Panju! <em>(To <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.)</em> That’s why I’m here, of course. Panju. He’s in trouble again. I wanted to just send a Howler but Padma insisted I come in person. I don’t know why.
  He just laughs at me.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But . . . you’re married to Hermione.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Beat. <span class="sc">RON</span> doesn’t understand this at all.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Hermione. No. Nooooo. Merlin’s beard.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus has also forgotten that he was sorted into Gryffindor. Conveniently.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Yes, well, sorry, old chap, but you’re a Gryffindor.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But how did I get sorted into Gryffindor?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> You persuaded the Sorting Hat, don’t you remember? Panju bet you that you couldn’t get into Gryffindor if your life depended on it, so
  you chose Gryffindor to spite him. I can’t blame you, <em>(dry)</em> we’d all like to wipe the smile off his face sometimes, wouldn’t we? <em>(Terrified.)</em> Please don’t tell
  Padma I said that.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Who’s Panju?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> and <span class="sc">HARRY</span> stare at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Bloody hell, you’re really not yourself, are you?

You do this, or you get in deeper, much deeper trouble — do you understand?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus? You’re okay. That’s fantastic.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He’s completely cured.
