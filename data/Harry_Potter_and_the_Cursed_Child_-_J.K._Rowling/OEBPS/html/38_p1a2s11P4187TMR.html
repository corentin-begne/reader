Our train absconder. Finally joining us.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Hermione?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks amazed. <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> is standing at the front of the lesson.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Professor Granger I believe is my name, Potter.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What are you doing here?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Teaching. For my sins. What are you doing here? Learning, I hope.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But you’re . . . you’re . . . Minister for Magic.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Been having those dreams again, have you, Potter? Today we’re going to look at Patronus Charms.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(amazed)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You’re our Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?</p>   <p class="textbreak2"><em>There are titters.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Losing patience now. Ten points from Gryffindor for stupidity.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">POLLY CHAPMAN</span> <em>(standing, full of affront)</em><span class="sc">:</span> No. No. He’s doing it deliberately. He hates Gryffindor and everyone
  knows it.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Sit down, Polly Chapman, before this gets even worse. <em>(<span class="sc">POLLY</span> sighs and then sits.)</em> And I suggest you join her,
  Albus. And end this charade.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But you’re not this mean.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And that’s twenty points from Gryffindor to assure Albus Potter that I am this mean.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YANN FREDERICKS:</span> If you don’t sit down right now, Albus . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> sits.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Can I just say —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> No, you can’t. Just keep quiet, Potter, otherwise you’ll lose what limited popularity you already have. Now who can tell me what
  a Patronus is? No? No one. You really are a most disappointing bunch.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> smiles a thin smile. She really is quite mean.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No. This is stupid. Where’s Rose? She’ll tell you that you’re being ridiculous.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Who’s Rose? Your invisible friend?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Rose Granger-Weasley! Your daughter! <em>(He realizes.)</em> Of course — because you and Ron aren’t married Rose —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s giggling.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> How dare you! Fifty points from Gryffindor. And I assure you if anyone interrupts me again it’ll be a hundred
  points . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She stares around the room. No one moves a muscle.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Good. A Patronus is a magical charm, a projection of all your most positive feelings, and takes the shape of the animal with whom you share the deepest affinity. It is a gift
  of light. If you can conjure a Patronus, you can protect yourself against the world. Which, in some of our cases, seems like a necessity sooner rather than later.</p></body></html>
