  natural risk-taker as you know. I’ve never been to Hogwarts. Pretty lax security here, isn’t there? And so many portraits. And corridors. And ghosts! This half-headless, strange-looking
  ghost told me where I could find you, can you believe that?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’ve never been to Hogwarts?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I was — unwell — as a child — for a few years. Other people got to go — I did not.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You were too — ill? I’m sorry, I didn’t know that.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I don’t advertise the fact — I prefer not to be seen as a tragic case, you know?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>This registers with <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.

Albus owled me. The history books changed but not enough — Cedric still died. In fact, failing the first task only made him more
  determined to win the second.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And Ron and Hermione have gone completely skewwhiff — and I still haven’t figured out why.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> And that’s why Cedric has to wait. It’s all become quite confused and you’re entirely right to be keeping hold of the
  Time-Turner, Scorpius. But what I meant was — someone’s got to do something about the two of you.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Oh.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You’re best friends. Every owl he sends I can feel your absence. He’s destroyed by it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Sounds like he’s found a shoulder to cry on. How many owls has he sent you now?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> smiles softly.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Sorry. That’s — I didn’t mean — I just — don’t understand what’s going on. I’ve tried to see him, talk to him, but every time I
  do he runs off.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You know, I didn’t have a best friend when I was your age. I wanted one. Desperately. When I was younger I even invented one but
  —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I had one of those too. Called Flurry. We fell out over the correct rules of Gobstones.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Albus needs you, Scorpius. That’s a wonderful thing.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> He needs me to do what?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> That’s the thing, isn’t it? About friendships. You don’t know what he needs. You only know he needs it. Find him, Scorpius.
  You two — you belong together.</p></body></html>
