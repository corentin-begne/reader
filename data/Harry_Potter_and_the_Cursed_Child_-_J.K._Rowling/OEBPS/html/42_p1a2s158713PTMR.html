Harry does most of the cooking.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> I can’t talk to him either. Scorpius. Especially since — Astoria has gone. I can’t even talk about how losing her has affected
  him. As hard as I try, I can’t reach him. You can’t talk to Albus. I can’t talk to Scorpius. That’s what this is about. Not about my son being evil. Because as much as you
  might take the word of a haughty centaur, you know the power of friendship.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Draco, whatever you may think . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> I always envied you them, you know — Weasley and Granger. I had —</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Crabbe and Goyle.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Two lunks who wouldn’t know one end of a broomstick from another. You — the three of you — you shone, you know? You liked each
  other. You had fun. I envied you those friendships more than anything else.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I envied them too.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, surprised.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I need to protect him —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> My father thought he was protecting me. Most of the time. I think you have to make a choice — at a certain point — of the man you
  want to be. And I tell you that at that time you need a parent or a friend. And if you’ve learnt to hate your parent by then and you have no friends . . . then you’re all
  alone. And being alone — that’s so hard. I was alone. And it sent me to a truly dark place. For a long time. Tom Riddle was also a lonely child. You may not understand that, Harry, but
  I do — and I think Ginny does too.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> He’s right.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Tom Riddle didn’t emerge from his dark place. And so Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort. Maybe the black cloud Bane saw was Albus’s
  loneliness. His pain. His hatred. Don’t lose the boy. You’ll regret it. And so will he. Because he needs you, and Scorpius, whether or not he now knows it.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">DRACO</span>, he thinks.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>He opens his mouth to speak.
