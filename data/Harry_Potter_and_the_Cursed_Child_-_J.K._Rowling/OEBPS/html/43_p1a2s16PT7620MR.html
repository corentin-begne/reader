He looks left and right. And then he sees <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>. And <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> sees
  him.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Hi.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius. I can’t . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I know. You’re in Gryffindor now. You don’t want to see me now. But here I am anyway. Talking to you.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Well, I can’t talk so . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You have to. You think you can just ignore everything that’s happened? The world has gone crazy, have you noticed?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know, okay? Ron’s gone strange. Hermione’s a professor, it’s all wrong, but . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And Rose doesn’t exist.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know. Look, I don’t understand everything but you can’t be here.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Because of what we did, Rose wasn’t even born. Do you remember being told about the Triwizard Tournament Yule Ball? All the four
  Triwizard champions took a partner. Your dad took Parvati Patil, Viktor Krum took —</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Hermione. And Ron got jealous and behaved like a prat.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Only he didn’t. I found Rita Skeeter’s book about them. And it’s very different. Ron took Hermione to the ball.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">POLLY CHAPMAN:</span> Sshhhh!</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">POLLY</span> and drops his volume.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> As friends. And they danced in a friendly way, and it was nice, and then he danced with Padma Patil and that was nicer, and they started
  dating and he changed a bit and then they got married and meanwhile Hermione became a —</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> — psychopath.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Hermione was supposed to go to that ball with Krum — do you know why she didn’t? Because she had suspicions the two strange
  Durmstrang boys she met before the first task were somehow involved in the disappearance of Cedric’s wand. She believed we — under Viktor’s orders — cost Cedric the first
  task . . .</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Wow.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And without Krum, Ron never got jealous and that jealousy was all-important and so Ron and Hermione stayed very good friends but never fell
  in love — never got married — <em>never had Rose</em>.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So that’s why Dad’s so — did he change too?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I’m pretty sure your dad is exactly the same. Head of Magical Law Enforcement. Married to Ginny. Three kids.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So why is he being such a —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A <span class="sc">LIBRARIAN</span> enters at the back of the room.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Have you heard me, Albus? This is bigger than you and your dad. Professor Croaker’s law — the furthest someone can go back in
  time without the possibility of serious harm to the traveler or time itself is five hours. And we went back years. The smallest moment, the smallest change, it creates ripples. And we —
  we’ve created really bad ripples. Rose was never born because of what we did. Rose.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LIBRARIAN:</span> Ssshhh!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> thinks quickly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Fine, let’s go back — fix it. Get Cedric and Rose back.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> . . . is the wrong answer.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’ve still got the Time-Turner, right? No one found it?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> takes it out of his pocket.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes, but . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> snatches it from his hand.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">No. Don’t . . . Albus. Don’t you understand how bad things could get?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> grabs for the Time-Turner, <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> pushes him back, they wrestle inexpertly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Things need fixing, Scorpius. Cedric still needs saving. Rose needs bringing back. We’ll be more careful. Whatever Croaker says, trust me,
  trust us. We’ll get it right this time.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. We won’t. Give it back, Albus! Give it back!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I can’t. This is too important.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes, it’s too important — for us. We’re not good at this stuff. We’ll get it wrong.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Who’s saying that we’ll get it wrong?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> <em>I</em> say. Because that’s <em>what we do</em>. We mess things up. We lose. We’re losers, true and total losers. Haven’t
  you realized that yet?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> finally gets the upper hand and pins <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> to the ground.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Well, I wasn’t a loser before I met you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, whatever you’ve got to prove to your dad — this isn’t the way.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I don’t have anything to prove to my dad. I’ve got to save Cedric to save Rose. And maybe — without you holding me back
  — I can make a proper go of it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Without me? Oh poor Albus Potter. With his chip on his shoulder. Poor Albus Potter. So sad.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What are you saying?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(exploding)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Try my life! People look at you because your dad’s the famous Harry Potter, savior of the
  wizarding world. People look at me because they think my dad is Voldemort. Voldemort.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Don’t even —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Can you even slightly imagine what that’s like? Have you even ever tried? No. Because you can’t see beyond the end of your nose.
  Because you can’t see beyond the end of your stupid thing with your dad. He will always be Harry Potter, you know that, right? And you will always be his son. And I know it’s hard, and
  the other kids are awful, but you have to learn to be okay with that, because — there are worse things, okay?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Beat.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">There was a moment I was excited, when I realized time was different, a moment when I thought maybe my mum hadn’t got sick. Maybe my mum wasn’t dead. But no, turns
  out, she was. I’m still the child of Voldemort, without a mother, giving sympathy to the boy who doesn’t ever give anything back. So I’m sorry if I’ve ruined your life
  because I tell you — you wouldn’t have a chance of ruining mine — it was already ruined. You just didn’t make it better. Because you’re a terrible — the most
  terrible — friend.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> digests this. He sees what he’s done to his friend.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> <em>(from off)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Albus? Albus Potter. Scorpius Malfoy. Are you in there — together? Because I
  advise you not to be.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, he pulls a Cloak from his bag.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Quick. We need to hide.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius, look at me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That’s the Invisibility Cloak? Isn’t it James’s?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> If she finds us, we’ll be forced apart forever. Please. I didn’t understand. Please.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> <em>(from off — trying to give them every chance)</em><span class="sc">:</span> I am about to enter.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> comes into the room, the Marauder’s Map in her hands. The boys disappear beneath the Cloak. She looks around,
  exasperated.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Well, where have they — I never wanted this thing and now it’s playing tricks on me.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She thinks. She looks back at the map. She identifies where they should be. She looks around the room. Objects move as the boys invisibly move past them. She sees where
  they’re heading, she makes to block them. But they skirt around her.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Unless. Unless . . . Your father’s Cloak.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She looks back at the map, she looks at the boys. She smiles to herself.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Well, if I didn’t see you, I didn’t see you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She exits. The two boys remove the Cloak. They sit in silence for a moment.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes, I stole this from James. He’s remarkably easy to steal from; his trunk combination is the date he got his first broom. I’ve
  found the Cloak made avoiding bullies . . . easier.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> nods.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">I’m sorry — about your mum. I know we don’t talk about her enough — but I hope you know — I’m sorry — it’s rubbish — what
  happened to her — to you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Thanks.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> My dad said — said that you were this dark cloud around me. My dad started to think — and I just knew I had to stay away, and if I
  didn’t, Dad said he would —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Your dad thinks the rumors are true — I am the son of Voldemort?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(nods)</em><span class="sc">:</span> His department are currently investigating it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Good. Let them. Sometimes — sometimes I find myself thinking — maybe they’re true too.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No. They’re not true. And I’ll tell you why. Because I don’t think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son — and
  you’re kind, Scorpius. To the depths of your belly, to the tips of your fingers. I truly believe Voldemort — Voldemort couldn’t have a child like you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Beat. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> is moved by this.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That’s nice — that’s a nice thing to say.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And it’s something I should have said a long time ago. In fact, you’re probably the best person I know. And you don’t —
  you couldn’t — hold me back. You make me stronger — and when Dad forced us apart — without you —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I didn’t much like my life without you in it either.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And I know I’ll always be Harry Potter’s son — and I will sort that out in my head — and I know compared to you my life
  is pretty good, really, and that he and I are comparatively lucky and —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(interrupting)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Albus, as apologies go this is wonderfully fulsome, but you’re starting to talk more
  about <em>you</em> than <em>me</em> again, so probably better to quit while you’re ahead.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> smiles and stretches out a hand.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Friends?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Always.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> extends his hand, <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> pulls <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> up into a hug.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">That’s the second time you’ve done that.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The two boys break apart and smile.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But I’m pleased we had this argument because it’s given me a really good idea.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> About what?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It involves the second task. And humiliation.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re still talking about going back in time? Have we been having the same conversation?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’re right — we are losers. We’re brilliant at losing and so we should be using our own knowledge here. Our own powers.
  Losers are taught to be losers. And there’s only one way to teach a loser — and we know that better than anyone — humiliation. We need to humiliate him. So in the second task
  that’s what we’ll do.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> thinks — for a long time — and then smiles.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That’s a really good strategy.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I mean, quite spectacular. Humiliate Cedric to save Cedric. Clever. And Rose?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> That I’m saving as a sparkly surprise. I <em>can</em> do it without you — but I <em>want</em> you there. Because I want us to do this
  together. Set things right together. So . . . Will you come?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But, just a minute, isn’t — wasn’t — the second task took place in the lake, and you’re not allowed to leave
  the school building.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> grins.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes. About that . . . We need to find the girls’ bathroom on the first floor.</p></body></html>
