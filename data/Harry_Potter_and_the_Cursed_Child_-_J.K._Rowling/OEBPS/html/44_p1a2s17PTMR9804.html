  entirely.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Professor Granger.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> looks across, her heart leaps a bit too (though she won’t admit it).</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron. What are you doing here?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Panju got in a little trouble in Potions class. Was showing off, of course, and put the wrong thing with the wrong thing and now he has no
  eyebrows and a rather large mustache, apparently. Which doesn’t suit him. I didn’t want to come but Padma says that when it comes to facial growths, sons need their fathers. Have you
  done something with your hair?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Just combed it, I suspect.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Well . . .

  were — married. Ha-ha. Ha. Ha. Ridiculous, I know.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Very ridiculous.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> He even thought we had a daughter.

We’re — friends, and that’s all.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Absolutely. Only — friends.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Only — friends. Funny word — <em>friends</em>. Not that funny. Just a word really. Friends. Friend. Funny friend. You, my funny friend,
  my Hermione. Not that — not my Hermione, you understand — not MY Hermione — not MINE — you know, but . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I know.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a pause.
