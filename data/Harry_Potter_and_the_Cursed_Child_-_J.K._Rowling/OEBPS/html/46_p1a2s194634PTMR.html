In the center of it is a large Victorian sink.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> So let me get this right — the plan is Engorgement . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes. Scorpius, that soap, if you may . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> fishes a soap out of the sink.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">Engorgio.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>He fires a bolt from his wand across the room. The soap blows up to four times its size.</em></p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Nice. Consider me engorgimpressed.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The second task was the lake task. They had to retrieve something which was stolen from them, which turned out to be —</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> — people they loved.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Cedric used a Bubble-Head Charm to swim through the lake. All we do is follow him in there and use Engorgement to turn him into something rather
  larger. We know the Time-Turner doesn’t give us long, so we’re going to be quick. Get to him and Engorgio his head and watch him float out of the lake — away from the task —
  away from the competition . . .</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But — you still haven’t told me how we’re going to actually get to the lake . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>And then suddenly a jet of water emerges from the sink — and after it ascends a very wet <span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE</span>.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> Whoa. That feels good. Never used to enjoy that. But when you get to my age, you take what you can . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Of course — you’re a genius — Moaning Myrtle . . .</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE</span> swoops down onto <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> What did you call me? Do I moan? Am I moaning now? AM I? AM I?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No, I didn’t mean . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> What’s my name?</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Myrtle.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> Exactly — Myrtle. Myrtle Elizabeth Warren — a pretty name — my name — no need for the moaning.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Well . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE</span> <em>(she giggles)</em><span class="sc">:</span> It’s been a while. Boys. In my bathroom. In my girls’ bathroom. Well,
  that’s not right . . . But then again, I always did have a soft spot for the Potters. And I was moderately partial to a Malfoy too. Now how can I help you pair?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You were there, Myrtle — in the lake. They wrote about you. There must be a way out of these pipes.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> I’ve been everywhere. But where specifically were you thinking?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The second task. The lake task. In the Triwizard Tournament. Twenty-five years ago. Harry and Cedric.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> Such a shame the pretty one had to die. Not that your father is not pretty — but Cedric Diggory — you’d be amazed at
  how many girls I had to hear doing love incantations in this very bathroom . . . And the weeping after he was taken.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Help us, Myrtle, help us get into that same lake.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> You think I can help you travel in time?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We need you to keep a secret.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> I love secrets. I won’t tell a soul. Cross my heart and hope to die. Or — the equivalent. For ghosts. You know.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> nods at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, who reveals the Time-Turner.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We can travel in time. You’re going to help us travel the pipes. We’re going to save Cedric Diggory.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE</span> <em>(grins)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Well, that sounds like fun.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And we’ve no time to lose.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> This very sink. This very sink empties directly into the lake. It breaks every bylaw but this school has always been antiquated. Dive
  in and you will be piped straight to it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> pulls himself into the sink, dumping his cloak as he does. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> copies.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> hands <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> some green foliage in a bag.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Some for me and some for you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Gillyweed? We’re using gillyweed? To breathe underwater?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Just like my dad did. Now, are you ready?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Remember, this time we can’t be caught out by the clock . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Five minutes, that’s all we allow for — before we get pulled back to the present.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Tell me this is all going to be okay.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(grinning)</em><span class="sc">:</span> It’s all going to be entirely okay. Are you ready?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> takes the gillyweed and disappears down.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No, Albus — Albus —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks up, he and <span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE</span> are alone.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> I do like brave boys.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(a little bit scared, a tiny bit brave)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Then I’m entirely ready. For whatever comes.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He takes the gillyweed and disappears down.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE</span> is left alone onstage.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There is a giant whoosh of light and smash of noise. And time stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards</em> . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The boys are gone.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> appears at a run, a deep frown on his face, behind him <span class="sc">DRACO</span>, <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, and <span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus . . . Albus . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> He’s gone.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>They find the boys’ cloaks on the ground.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> <em>(consulting the map)</em><span class="sc">:</span> He’s disappeared. No, he’s traveling under Hogwarts grounds, no,
  he’s disappeared . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> How is he doing this?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> He’s using a rather pretty trinket thingy.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Myrtle!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> Oops, you caught me. And I was trying so hard to hide. Hello, Harry. Hello, Draco. Have you been bad boys again?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> What trinket is he using?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> I think it was a secret, but I could never keep anything from you, Harry. How is it you’ve grown handsomer and handsomer as
  you’ve aged? And you’re taller.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> My son is in danger. I need your help. What are they doing, Myrtle?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> He’s after saving a dishy boy. A certain Cedric Diggory.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> immediately realizes what’s happened, and is horrified.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> But Cedric Diggory died years ago . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> He seemed quite confident he could get around that fact. He’s very confident, Harry, just like you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He heard me talking — to Amos Diggory . . . could he have . . . the Ministry’s Time-Turner. No,
  that’s impossible.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> The Ministry has a Time-Turner? I thought they were destroyed?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MOANING MYRTLE:</span> Isn’t everyone so naughty?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Can someone please explain what’s going on?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus and Scorpius are not disappearing and reappearing — they’re traveling. Traveling in time.</p></body></html>
