  only TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT. If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>And now <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> are swimming through the lake. Descending through the water with graceful ease.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER.</p>       <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a slightly less limp cheer.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">The French are getting into this.</p>  <p class="textbreak2">And they’re off . . . Viktor’s a shark, of course he is, Fleur looks remarkable, ever plucky Harry is using gillyweed, clever Harry, very clever
  — and Cedric — well, Cedric, what a treat, ladies and gentlemen, Cedric is using a Bubble Charm to cruise through the lake.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CEDRIC DIGGORY</span> approaches them through the water, a bubble over his head. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> raise
  their wands together and fire an Engorgement Charm through the water.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak2"><em>He turns and looks at them, confused. And it hits him. And around him the water glows gold.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>And then <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> starts to grow — and grow again — and grow some more. He looks around himself — entirely panicked. And the boys
  watch as <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> ascends helplessly through the water.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak2">But no, what’s this . . . Cedric Diggory is ascending out of the water and seemingly out of the competition. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we don’t have
  our winner but we certainly have our loser. Cedric Diggory is turning into a balloon, and this balloon wants to fly. Fly, ladies and gentlemen, fly. Fly out of the task and out of the tournament
  and — oh my, it gets wilder still, around Cedric, fireworks <em>explode</em> declaiming — “Ron loves Hermione” — and the crowd love that — oh, ladies and
  gentlemen, the look on Cedric’s face. It’s quite some picture, it’s quite some sight, it’s quite some tragedy. This is a humiliation, there’s no other word for it.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>And <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> smiles widely and high-fives <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> in the water.</em></p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em>And <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> points up, and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> nods, and they start to swim ever upwards. And as <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> ascends,
  people start to laugh, and everything changes.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>The world becomes darker. The world becomes almost black, in fact.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>And there’s a flash. And a bang. And the Time-Turner ticks to a stop. And we’re back in the present.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> suddenly emerges, shooting up through the water. And he’s triumphant.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Woooo-hoooooo!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks around, surprised. Where’s <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>? He puts his arms into the air.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">We did it!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He waits another beat.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Albus?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> still doesn’t emerge. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> treads water, he thinks and then he ducks back into the water.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He emerges back up again. Now thoroughly panicked. He looks around.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Albus . . . ALBUS . . . ALBUS.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And there’s a whisper in Parseltongue. Which travels fast around the audience.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s coming.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Scorpius Malfoy. Get out of the lake. Get out of the lake. Right now.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls him out of the water.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Miss. I need help. Please, Miss.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Miss? I’m Professor Umbridge, the headmistress of your school, I’m no “Miss.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re the headmistress? But I . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> I am the headmistress, and however important your family may be — it doesn’t give you an excuse to dillydally, to mess
  about.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> There’s a boy in this lake. You need to get help. I’m looking for my friend, Miss. Professor. Headmaster. One of Hogwarts’s
  students, Miss. I’m looking for Albus Potter.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Potter? Albus Potter? There’s no such student. In fact, there hasn’t been a Potter at Hogwarts for years — and that
  boy didn’t turn out so well. Not so much rest in peace, Harry Potter, more rest in perpetual despair. Total troublemaker.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Harry Potter’s dead?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly from around the auditorium, the feel of a breath of the wind. Some black robes arise around people. Black robes that become black shapes. That become
  dementors.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Flying dementors through the auditorium. These black deadly shapes, these black deadly forces. They are everything to be feared. And they suck the spirit from the
  room.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The wind continues. This is hell. And then, right from the back of the room, whispering around everyone.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Words said with an unmistakable voice. The voice of <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span> . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Haaarry Pottttter.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span>’s dream has come to life.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Have you swallowed something funny in there? Become a Mudblood without any of us noticing? Harry Potter died over twenty years ago as
  part of that failed coup on the school — he was one of those Dumbledore terrorists we bravely overthrew at the Battle of Hogwarts. Now come along — I don’t know what game
  you’re playing but you’re upsetting the dementors and entirely ruining Voldemort Day.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And the Parseltongue whispers grow louder and louder. Grow monstrously loud. And giant banners with snake symbols upon them descend over the stage.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Voldemort Day?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>We cut to black.</em></p></body></html>
