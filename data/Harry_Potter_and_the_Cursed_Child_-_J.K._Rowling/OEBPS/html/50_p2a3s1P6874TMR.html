He is dressed in darker, blacker robes. He has a pensive look on his face. He

Thank you so much for coming to see me.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Headmistress.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Scorpius, I’ve thought for a long time that you have Head Boy potential, as you know. Pure-blooded, a natural leader,
  wonderfully athletic . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Athletic?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> No need to be modest, Scorpius. I’ve seen you on the Quidditch pitch, there’s rarely a Snitch you don’t catch. You
  are a highly valued student. Valued by the faculty. Valued especially by me. I’ve positively glowed about you in dispatches to the Augurey. Our work together flushing out the more dilettante
  students has made this school a safer, purer place —</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Has it?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>There is the sound of a scream from off. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> turns towards it.

How Potter died. Why Potter died. And this ludicrous fascination with
  Cedric Diggory. Scorpius, we’ve checked you for hexes and curses — there were none we can see — so I’m asking if there’s anything I can do — to restore you to
  what you were . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. No. Consider me restored. Temporary aberration. That’s all.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> So we can continue our work together?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> We can.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em>She puts her hand to her heart, and touches her wrists together.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> For Voldemort and Valor.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(trying to copy)</em><span class="sc">:</span> For — um — yes.</p>    </body>        </html>
