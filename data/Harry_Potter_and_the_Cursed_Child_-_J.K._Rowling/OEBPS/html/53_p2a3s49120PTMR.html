  <p class="chaptitle">HOGWARTS, LIBRARY</p>

  <p class="textfirst"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> enters the library and starts desperately to look through books. He finds a history book.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> How did Cedric become a Death Eater? What have I missed? Find me some — light in the darkness. Tell me your secrets. What have I
  missed?</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CRAIG BOWKER JR.:</span> Why are you here?</p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> turns to look at a rather desperate-looking <span class="sc">CRAIG</span>, his clothes tattered and worn.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Why can’t I be here?</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CRAIG BOWKER JR.:</span> It’s not ready yet. I’m working as fast as I can. But Professor Snape sets so much of it, and writing the essay in two
  different ways. I mean, I’m not complaining . . . Sorry.</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Start again. From the beginning. What’s not ready?</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CRAIG BOWKER JR.:</span> Your Potions homework. And I’m happy to do it — grateful even — and I know you hate homework and books and I never
  let you down, you know that.</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I hate homework?</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CRAIG BOWKER JR.:</span> You’re the Scorpion King. Of course you hate homework. What are you doing with <em>A History of Magic</em>? I could do that
  assignment too?</p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em>Pause. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">CRAIG</span> a moment and then walks away. <span class="sc">CRAIG</span> exits.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em>After a moment <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> returns with a frown.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Did he say Snape?</p>
