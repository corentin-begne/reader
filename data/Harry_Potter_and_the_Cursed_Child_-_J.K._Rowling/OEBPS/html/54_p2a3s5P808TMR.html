This is an honor.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Professor Snape will do fine. You may behave like a king at this school, Malfoy, but that doesn’t make us all your subjects.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But you’re the answer . . .</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> How very pleasant for me. If you’ve got something to say, boy, then please say it . . . If not, close the door on your way
  out.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I need your help.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> I exist to serve.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I just don’t know what help I — need. Are you still undercover now? Are you still working secretly for Dumbledore?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Dumbledore? Dumbledore’s dead. And my work for him was public — I taught in his school.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. That’s not all you did. You watched the Death Eaters for him. You advised him. Everyone thought you’d murdered him —
  but it turned out you’d been supporting him. You saved the world.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> These are very dangerous allegations, boy. And don’t think the Malfoy name will prevent me inflicting punishment.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> What if I was to tell you there was another world — another world in which Voldemort was defeated at the Battle of Hogwarts, in which
  Harry Potter and Dumbledore’s Army won, how would you feel then . . .</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> I’d say that the rumors of Hogwarts’s beloved Scorpion King losing his mind are well-founded.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> There was a stolen Time-Turner. I stole a Time-Turner. With Albus. We tried to bring Cedric Diggory back from the dead, when he was dead. We
  tried to stop him winning the Triwizard Tournament. But by doing so we turned him into an almost different person entirely.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Harry Potter won that Triwizard Tournament.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> He wasn’t supposed to do it alone. Cedric was supposed to win it with him. But we humiliated him out of the tournament. And as a result
  of that humiliation he became a Death Eater. I can’t work out what he did in the Battle of Hogwarts — whether he killed someone or — but he did something and it changed
  everything.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Cedric Diggory killed only one wizard and not a significant one — Neville Longbottom.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Oh, of course, that’s it! Professor Longbottom was supposed to kill Nagini, Voldemort’s snake. Nagini had to die before Voldemort
  could die. That’s it! You’ve solved it! We destroyed Cedric, he killed Neville, Voldemort won the battle. Can you see? Can you see it?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> I can see this is a Malfoy game. Get out before I alert your father and plunge you into deep trouble.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> thinks and then plays his final, desperate card.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You loved his mother. I don’t remember everything. I know you loved his mother. Harry’s mother. Lily. I know you spent years
  undercover. I know without you the war could never have been won. How would I know this if I hadn’t seen the other world . . . ?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> says nothing, overwhelmed.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Only Dumbledore knew, am I right? And when you lost him you must have felt so alone. I know you’re a good man. Harry Potter told his son you’re a great man.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> — unsure what’s going on. Is this a trick? He is quite seriously at a loss.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Harry Potter is dead.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Not in my world. He said you were the bravest man he’d ever met. He knew, you see — he knew your secret — what you did for
  Dumbledore. And he admired you for it — greatly. And that’s why he named his son — my best friend — after you both. Albus Severus Potter.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> is stopped. He is deeply moved.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Please — for Lily, for the world, help me.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> thinks and then walks up to <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, taking out his wand as he does. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> steps back,
  scared. <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> fires his wand at the door.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Colloportus!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>An invisible lock slams into place. <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> opens a hatch at the back of the classroom.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Well, come on, then . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Just a question, but where — exactly — are we going?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> We’ve had to move many times. Everywhere we’ve settled they destroyed. This will take us to a room hidden in the roots of the
  Whomping Willow.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Okay, who’s we?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Oh. You’ll see.</p></body></html>
