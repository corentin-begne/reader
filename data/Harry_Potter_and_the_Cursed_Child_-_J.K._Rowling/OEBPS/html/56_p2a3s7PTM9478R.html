Neville Longbottom? This is pretty wild.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> It’s true, Ron.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Right. And you’re sure because . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> What he knows about Snape — about all of us — there’s no way he could . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Maybe he’s a really good guesser?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I’m not. Can you help?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> We’re the only ones that can. Dumbledore’s Army has shrunk considerably since its peak. In fact, we’re pretty much all
  that’s left, but we’ve kept fighting on. Hiding in plain sight. Doing our best to tickle their nose hairs. Granger here is a wanted woman. I’m a wanted man.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> <em>(dryly)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Less wanted.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> To be clear: In this other world . . . ? Before you meddled?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Voldemort is dead. Killed in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry is Head of Magical Law Enforcement. You’re Minister for Magic.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> stops, surprised by this, she looks up with a smile.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’m Minister for Magic?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON</span> <em>(wanting to join the fun)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Brilliant. What do I do?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You run Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Okay, so, she’s Minister for Magic and I run a — joke shop?</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">RON</span>’s hurt face.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re mostly focused on bringing up your kids.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Great. I expect their mother is hot.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(blushing)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Well . . . Um . . . Depends what you think of . . .
  The thing is, you two sort of have kids — together. A daughter and a son.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The two look up, astonished.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Married. In love. Everything. You were shocked the other time too. When you were Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and Ron was married to Padma. You’re
  <em>constantly</em> surprised by it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> and <span class="sc">RON</span> both look at each other and then look away. And then <span class="sc">RON</span> looks back. <span class="sc">RON</span> clears his throat repeatedly. With less conviction each time.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Close your mouth when you’re looking at me, Weasley.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> does so. Though he remains discombobulated.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And — Snape? What does Snape do in this other world?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> I’m dead, presumably.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, whose face drops. <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> smiles thinly.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">You were a little too surprised to see me. How?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Bravely.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Who?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Voldemort.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> How very irritating.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a silence as <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> digests.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Still, there’s glory in being taken down by the Dark Lord himself, I suppose.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’m sorry, Severus.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> looks at her, and then swallows the pain. He indicates <span class="sc">RON</span> with a flick of his head.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Well, at least I’m not married to him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Which spells did you use?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Expelliarmus in the first task and Engorgio in the second.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Simple Shield Charms should set both of those right.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> And then you left?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The Time-Turner took us back, yes. That’s the thing — this Time-Turner, you only get five minutes in the past.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And can you still only move in time, not space?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes, yes, it’s — uh — you travel back in the same spot you stand in —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Interesting.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> and <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> both know what this means.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Then it’s just me and the boy.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> No offense, Snape, but I’m not trusting this to anyone, it’s too important.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Hermione, you’re the most wanted rebel in the wizarding world. Doing this will require you to go outside. When was the last time you were
  outside?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Not for a long time, but —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> If you’re found outside, the dementors will kiss you — they’ll suck out your soul.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Severus, I’m done with living off scraps, making failed attempts at coups. This is our chance to reset the world.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She nods at <span class="sc">RON</span>, who pulls down a map.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">The first task of the tournament took place at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. We turn time here, get to the tournament, block the spell, and then return safely. With
  precision — it can be done and it won’t require us to show our faces outside in our time at all. Then we’ll turn time again, make our way to the lake, and reverse the second
  task.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> You’re risking everything —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We get this right, Harry’s alive, Voldemort’s dead, and the Augurey is gone, for that no risk is too great. Though I am sorry
  what it will cost you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Sometimes costs are made to be borne.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The two look at each other, <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> nods, <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> nods back, <span class="sc">SNAPE</span>’s face crumbles
  slightly.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">I didn’t just quote Dumbledore, did I?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(with a smile)</em><span class="sc">:</span> No, I’m pretty sure that’s pure Severus Snape.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She turns to <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, she indicates the Time-Turner.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Malfoy—</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> brings her the Time-Turner. She smiles at it, excited to use a Time-Turner again, excited to use it for this.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Let’s hope this works.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She takes the Time-Turner. It begins to vibrate, and then explodes into a storm of movement.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And there is a giant whoosh of light. A smash of noise.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And time stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards, slow at first . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There is a bang and a flash and our gang disappear.</em></p></body></html>
