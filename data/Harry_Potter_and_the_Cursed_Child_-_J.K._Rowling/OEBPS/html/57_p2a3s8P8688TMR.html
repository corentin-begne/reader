  <p class="chaptitle">EDGE OF THE FORBIDDEN FOREST, 1994</p>

  <p class="textfirst"><em>And we watch our scene from Part One replayed, but at the back of the stage rather than the front. We pick out <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> in their Durmstrang robes. And through it all we hear the “brilliant” (his words again, his words) <span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN</span>.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak3"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span>, <span class="sc">RON</span>, and <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> watch out anxiously.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> And Cedric Diggory has entered the stage. And he seems ready. Scared but ready. He dodges this way. He dodges that. The girls swoon as he
  dives for cover. They cry as one: Don’t damage our Diggory, Mr. Dragon! And Cedric skirts left and he dives right — and he readies his wand —</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> This is taking too long. The Time-Turner is spinning.</p>

  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> What has this young, brave, handsome man got up his sleevies now?</p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em>As <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> attempts to summon <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span>’s wand, <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> blocks his spell. He looks at his wand
  — disconsolate, unsure why it hasn’t worked.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak2"><em>And then the Time-Turner spins and they look at it and panic as they’re pulled into it.</em></p>

  <p class="textbreak2">A dog — he’s transfigured a stone into a dog — dog diggity, Cedric Diggory — you are a doggy dynamo.</p>
