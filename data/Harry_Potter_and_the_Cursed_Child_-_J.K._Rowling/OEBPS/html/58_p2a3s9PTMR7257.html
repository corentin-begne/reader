  the mess they’re in.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Ow. Ow. Owwwwwww.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron . . . Ron . . . What has it done to you?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Oh no. I knew it.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The Time-Turner did something to Albus too. The first time we went back.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Useful — time to — ow — tell us.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> We’re aboveground. We need to move. Now.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron, you can still walk, come on . . .</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> does stand up, shouting in pain. <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> raises his wand.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Did it work?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We blocked the spell. Cedric kept his wand. Yes. It worked.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> But we came back to the wrong place — we are outside. You are outside.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> We need to use the Time-Turner again — get out of here —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> We need to find shelter. We’re horribly exposed.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly from around the auditorium, the feel of the breath of an icy wind.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>Some black robes arise around people. Black robes that become black shapes. That become dementors.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Too late.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> This is a disaster.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(she realizes what she has to do)</em><span class="sc">:</span> They’re after me, not any of you. Ron. I love you and I always have.
  But the three of you need to run. Go. Now.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Can we talk about the love thing first?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> This is still Voldemort’s world. And I am done with it. Reversing the next task will change everything.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But they’ll kiss you. They’ll suck out your soul.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And then you’ll change the past. And then they won’t. Go. Now.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The dementors sense them. From all sides, screaming shapes descend.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Go. We go.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He pulls on <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s arm. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> reluctantly goes with him.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> looks at <span class="sc">RON</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> You’re supposed to be going too.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Well, they are after me a bit and I really am in quite a lot of pain. And, you know, I’d rather be here. Expecto —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>As he reaches up to cast the spell, <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> stops his arm.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Let’s keep them here and give the boy the best chance we can.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> looks at her and then nods sadly.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">A daughter.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> And a son.

And then the two are yanked apart. And pinned to the ground. And we watch as a golden-whitish haze is pulled from their
  bodies. They have their souls sucked from them. And it is terrifying.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> watches — helplessly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Let’s get down to the water. Walk. Don’t run.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Stay calm, Scorpius. They may be blind but they can sense your fear.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">SNAPE</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> They just sucked out their souls.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A dementor swoops down low over them and settles in front of <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Think of something else, Scorpius. Occupy your thoughts.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I feel cold. I can’t see. There’s a fog inside me — around me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> You’re a king, and I’m a professor. They’ll only attack with good reason. Think about those you love, think about why
  you’re doing this.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I can hear my mother. She wants me — my help — but she knows I can’t — help.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Listen to me, Scorpius. Think about Albus. You’re giving up your kingdom for Albus, right?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> is helpless. Consumed by all the dementor is making him feel.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">One person. All it takes is one person. I couldn’t save Harry for Lily. So now I give my allegiance to the cause she believed in. And it’s possible — that
  along the way I started believing in it myself.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> smiles at <span class="sc">SNAPE</span>. He steps decisively away from the dementor.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The world changes and we change with it. I am better off in this world. But the world is not better. And I don’t want that.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly <span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE</span> emerges in front of them.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Professor Snape!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Professor Umbridge.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Have you heard the news? We’ve caught that traitorous Mudblood Hermione Granger. She was just out here.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> That’s — fantastic.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">UMBRIDGE</span> is staring at <span class="sc">SNAPE</span>. He looks back.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> With you. Granger was with you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> With me? You’re mistaken.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> With you and Scorpius Malfoy. A student I’m becoming increasingly concerned about.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Well . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Dolores, we’re late for class, so if you’ll excuse us . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> If you’re late for class, why are you not heading back to the school? Why are you heading to the lake?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a moment of pure silence. And then <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> does something hugely unusual — he smiles.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> How long have you suspected?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">UMBRIDGE</span> rises off the ground. She opens her arms wide, full of Dark Magic. She takes out her wand.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DOLORES UMBRIDGE:</span> Years. And I should have acted upon it far earlier.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> is faster with his wand.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Depulso!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">UMBRIDGE</span> is propelled backwards through the air.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">She always was too grand for her own good. There’s no turning back now.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The sky turns even blacker still around them.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Expecto Patronum!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> sends forward a Patronus, and it’s a beautiful white shape of a doe.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> A doe? Lily’s Patronus.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Strange, isn’t it? What comes from within.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Dementors start to appear all around them. <span class="sc">SNAPE</span> knows what this means.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">You need to run. I will keep them at bay for as long as I can.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Thank you for being my light in the darkness.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> looks at him, every inch a hero, he softly smiles.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SNAPE:</span> Tell Albus — tell Albus Severus — I’m proud he carries my name. Now go. Go.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The doe looks back at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, and then starts to run.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> thinks and then runs after the doe, and around him the world gets scarier. A bloodcurdling scream goes up at one side. He sees the lake and
  throws himself inside.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> readies himself.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SNAPE</span> is pulled hard to the ground and then pushed high into the air as his soul is ripped from him. As the screams just seem to multiply.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The doe turns to him with beautiful eyes, and disappears.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There is a bang and a flash. And then silence. And then there’s more silence.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>It’s so still, it’s so peaceful, it’s so perfectly tranquil.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then — <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> ascends to the surface. Breathing deeply. He looks around himself. Breathing deep, panicked breaths. He looks up at the
  sky. The sky certainly seems — bluer than before.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> ascends after him. There’s a silence. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> just looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>,
  disbelieving. Both boys breathe in and out.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Whoa!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> That was close! Did you see that Merman? The guy with the — and then the thing with the — whoa!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> It’s you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It was weird though — I thought I saw Cedric start to expand — but then he sort of started shrinking again — and I looked at
  you and you had your wand out . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You have no idea how good it is to see you again.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You just saw me two minutes ago.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> hugs <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> in the water, a difficult task.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> A lot has happened since then.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Careful. You’re drowning me. What are you wearing?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> What am I wearing? <em>(He pulls off his cloak.)</em> What are <em>you</em> wearing? Yes! You’re in Slytherin.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Did it work? Did we do anything?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. And it’s brilliant.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at him — disbelieving.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What? We failed.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes. YES. AND IT’S AMAZING.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He splashes hard in the water. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> pulls himself out to the bank.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius. Have you been eating too many sweets again?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> There you go, you see — all dry humor and Albus-y. I love it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Now I’m starting to get worried . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> enters and sprints to the side of the water.
