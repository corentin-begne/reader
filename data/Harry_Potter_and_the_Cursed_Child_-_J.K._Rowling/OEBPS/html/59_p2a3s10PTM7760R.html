  <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>. <span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> is fuming.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> So to be clear — you illegally jumped off the Hogwarts Express, you invaded and stole from the Ministry of Magic, you took
  it upon yourself to change time, whereupon you disappeared two people —</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I agree it doesn’t sound good.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> And your response to disappearing Hugo and Rose Granger-Weasley was to go back in time again — and this time, instead of
  losing two people you lost a huge number of people and killed your father — and in doing so you resurrected the worst wizard the world has ever known and heralded in a new age of Dark Magic.
  <em>(Dry.)</em> You’re correct, Mr. Potter, it doesn’t sound good, does it? Are you aware how stupid you’ve been?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes, Professor.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> hesitates a moment. He looks at <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.</em></p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Professor, if I may —</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> You may not. What you choose to do as parents is your matter but this is my school, and these are my students, and I will choose
  what punishment they will face.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Seems fair.</p>   <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, who shakes her head.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> I should expel you but <em>(with a look to <span class="sc">HARRY</span>)</em> all things considered — I think it might be
  safer for you to remain in my care. You are in detention for — well, you can consider yourself in detention for the rest of the year. Christmas is canceled for you. You can forget visiting
  Hogsmeade ever again. And that’s just the start . . .</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> bursts in. All action and resolve.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> What did I miss?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> <em>(fierce)</em><span class="sc">:</span> It is considered polite to knock when entering a room, Hermione Granger, maybe you missed
  that.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> realizes she’s overstepped.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ah.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> If I could also give a detention to you, Minister, I would. Keeping hold of a Time-Turner, of all the stupid things!</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> In my defense —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> And in a bookcase. You kept it in a bookcase. It’s almost laughable.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Minerva. <em>(There is an intake of breath.)</em> Professor McGonagall —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> Your children didn’t exist!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> has no reply to that.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">This happened in my school, under my watch. After all that Dumbledore did, I couldn’t live with myself . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I know.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL</span> <em>(composes herself for a moment)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Your intentions to save Cedric were honorable, if misguided. And
  it does sound as if you were brave, Scorpius, and you, Albus, but the lesson even your father sometimes failed to heed is that bravery doesn’t forgive stupidity. Always think. Think
  what’s possible. A world controlled by Voldemort is —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> A horrific world.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> You are so young. <em>(She looks at <span class="sc">HARRY</span>, <span class="sc">DRACO</span>, <span class="sc">GINNY</span>,
  and <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span>.)</em> You’re all so young. You have no idea how dark the wizarding wars got. You were — reckless — with the world some people — some
  very dear friends of mine and yours — sacrificed a huge amount to create and sustain.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes, Professor.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes, Professor.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> Go on. Get out. The lot of you. And find me that Time-Turner.</p></body></html>
