  spill.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Thanks for letting me come up.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> turns, he nods at his dad. He’s being cautious too.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">No luck, as yet, with the Time-Turner searching. They’re negotiating with the Merpeople to dredge the lake.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>He sits down uncomfortably.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">This is a nice room.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Green is a soothing color, isn’t it? I mean Gryffindor rooms are all well and good but the trouble with red is — it is said to send
  you a little mad — not that I’m casting aspersions . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Can you explain why you tried to do this?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I thought I could — change things. I thought Cedric — it’s unfair.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Of course it’s unfair, Albus, don’t you think I know that? I was there. I saw him die. But to do this . . . to risk
  all this . . .</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(failing to contain his anger)</em><span class="sc">:</span> If you were trying to do as I did, you went the wrong way about it. I didn’t
  volunteer for adventure, I was forced into it. You did something really reckless — something really stupid and dangerous — something that could have destroyed everything —</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know. Okay. I know.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>Pause. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> wipes away a tear, <span class="sc">HARRY</span> notices it and takes a breath.

He wasn’t a black cloud.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And I’ve locked away the map. You won’t see it again. Your mum left your room exactly as it was when you ran away — you know
  that? Wouldn’t let me go in — wouldn’t let anyone go in — you really scared her . . . And me.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Really scared you?</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Yes.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I thought Harry Potter wasn’t afraid of anything?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Is that how I make you feel?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at his dad, trying to figure him out.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I don’t think Scorpius said, but when we returned after failing to fix the first task, I was suddenly in Gryffindor House. Nothing was
  better between us then either — so — the fact that I’m in Slytherin — that’s not the reason for our problems. It’s not just about that.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No. I know.
