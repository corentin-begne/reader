He has a small bunch of flowers in his hand.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> Go on then, lay down your grotty little flowers and then let’s go. I already hate this poxy little village, I don’t know why
  I even had the thought — Godric’s Hollow, Godless Hollow, more like, the place is clearly a hive of filth — go on, chop-chop.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>He approaches the grave. He stands a moment more.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>Now</em>, Harry . . . I don’t have time for this. Duddy has his Cubs tonight and you know he hates to be late.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> Aunt Petunia. We’re their last living relatives, right?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> Yes. You and I. Yes.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> And — they weren’t popular? You said they didn’t have any friends?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> Lily tried — bless her — she tried — it wasn’t her fault, but she repelled people — by her very nature. It
  was her intensity, it was her manner, it was her — way. And your father — obnoxious man — extraordinarily obnoxious. No friends. Neither of them.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> So my question is — why are there so many flowers? Why are there flowers all over their grave?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA</span> looks around, she sees all the flowers as if for the first time and it moves her hugely. She approaches and then sits by her
  sister’s grave, trying hard to fight the emotions as they come to her but succumbing all the same.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA:</span> Oh. Yes. Well, I suppose there are a — few. Must have blown over from the other graves. Or someone’s playing a trick. Yes, I
  think that’s most likely, some young rapscallion with too much time on his hands has gone around collecting flowers from all the other graves and deposited them here —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY:</span> But they’re all marked with their names . . . “Lily and James, what you did, we will never forget,”
  “Lily and James, your sacrifice . . .”</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">VOLDEMORT:</span> I smell guilt, there is a stench of guilt upon the air.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">AUNT PETUNIA</span> <em>(to <span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY</span>)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Get away. Get away from there.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls him back. <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span>’s hand rises into the air above the Potters’ gravestone, the rest of him rises after. We don’t see
  his face but his body provides a jagged, horrific shape.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">I knew it. This place is dangerous. The sooner we leave Godric’s Hollow the better.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY</span> is pulled from the stage, but turns to face <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">VOLDEMORT:</span> Do you still see with my eyes, Harry Potter?</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">YOUNG HARRY</span> exits, disturbed, as <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> bursts from within <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span>’s cloak. He reaches out a
  desperate hand towards his dad.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad . . . Dad . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There are some words spoken in Parseltongue.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s coming.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then a scream.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then, right from the back of the room, whispering around everyone.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Words said with an unmistakable voice.
