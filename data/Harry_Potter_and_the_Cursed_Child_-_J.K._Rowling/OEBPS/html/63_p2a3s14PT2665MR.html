Psst . . . Albus.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> doesn’t wake.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">ALBUS!</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> wakes with a shock. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> laughs.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Pleasant. That’s a pleasant and not scary way to wake up.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You know it’s the strangest of things, but ever since being in the scariest place imaginable I’m pretty much good with fear. I am
  — Scorpius the Dreadless. I am — Malfoy the Unanxious.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Good.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I mean, normally, being in lockdown, being in constant detention, it’d break me, but now — what’s the worst they can do?
  Bring back Moldy Voldy and have him torture me? Nope.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’re scary when you’re in a good mood, you know that?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> When Rose came up to me today in Potions and called me Bread Head I almost hugged her. No, there’s no almost about it, I actually tried
  to hug her, and then she kicked me in the shin.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’m not sure being fearless is going to be good for your health.</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>, his face grows more contemplative.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You don’t know how good it is to be back here, Albus. I hated it there.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Apart from the Polly Chapman fancying you bits.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Cedric was a different person entirely — dark, dangerous. My dad — doing anything they wanted him to. And me? I discovered
  another Scorpius, you know? Entitled, angry, mean — people were frightened of me. It feels like we were all tested and we all — failed.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But you changed things. You had a chance and you changed time back. Changed yourself back.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Only because I knew what I should be.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> digests this.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Do you think I’ve been tested too? I have, haven’t I?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. Not yet.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’re wrong. The stupid thing wasn’t going back once — anyone can make that mistake — the stupid thing was being
  arrogant enough to go back twice.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> We both went back, Albus.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And why was I so determined to do this? Cedric? Really? No. I had something to prove. My dad’s right — he didn’t volunteer for
  adventure — me, this, it’s all my fault—and if it wasn’t for you everything could have gone Dark.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But it didn’t. And you’re to thank for that as much as me. When the dementors were — inside my head — Severus Snape
  told me to think of you. You may not have been there, Albus, but you were fighting — fighting alongside me.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> nods. Touched by this.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And saving Cedric — that wasn’t such a bad idea — not in my head, anyway — though, you know, right — that we definitely can’t try
  again.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Yes. I do. I do know that.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Good. Then you can help me destroy this.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> reveals the Time-Turner to <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’m pretty sure you told everyone that was on the bottom of a lake.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Turns out Malfoy the Unanxious is a pretty good liar.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius . . . We should tell someone about this . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Who? The Ministry kept it before, do you really trust them not to keep it again? Only you and I have experienced how dangerous this is, that
  means you and I have to destroy it. No one can do what we did, Albus. No one. No, <em>(slightly grandly)</em> it’s time that time-turning became a thing of the past.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’re quite proud of that phrase, aren’t you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Been working on it all day.</p></body></html>
