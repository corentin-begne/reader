There’s soft hooting all around them.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> So I think a simple Confringo.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Definitely not. For something like this you need Expulso.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Expulso? Expulso and we’ll be clearing bits of Time-Turner from this owlery for days.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Bombarda?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And wake up everyone in Hogwarts? Maybe Stupefy. They were originally destroyed using Stupefy . . .</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Exactly, it’s been done before — let’s do something new, something fun.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Fun? Look, many wizards overlook the importance of choosing the right spell, but this really matters. I think it’s a
  much-underestimated part of modern witchcraft.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> “A much-underestimated part of modern witchcraft” — you two are the greatest, you know that?</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks up, surprised to see <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> has emerged behind them.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Wow. You’re . . . um . . . What are you doing here?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It felt important to send an owl — let her know what we’re doing, you know?</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at his friend accusingly.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">This concerns her too.</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> thinks, and then nods, accepting this.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> What concerns me? What’s this about?</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> gets out the Time-Turner.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We need to destroy the Time-Turner. The things Scorpius saw after the second task . . . I’m so sorry. We can’t risk
  going back again. We can’t save your cousin.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> looks at it and then at them both.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Your owl said so little . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Imagine the worst possible world, and then double it. People being tortured, dementors everywhere, a despotic Voldemort, my dad dead, me never
  born, the world surrounded by Dark Magic — we just, we can’t allow that to happen.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> hesitates. And then her face breaks.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Voldemort ruled? He was alive?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> He ruled everything. It was terrible.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Because of what we did?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Humiliating Cedric turned him into a very angry young man, and then he became a Death Eater and — and — it all went wrong. Really
  wrong.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s face carefully. Her face sinks.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> A Death Eater?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And a murderer. He killed Professor Longbottom.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Then — of course — we need to destroy it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You understand?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I’ll go further than that — I’ll say Cedric would have understood. We’ll destroy it together, and then we’ll go
  to my uncle. Explain the situation.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Thank you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> smiles at them sadly, and then takes the Time-Turner. She looks at it and her expression changes slightly.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Oh, nice mark.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span>’s cloak has loosened. An Augurey tattoo is visible on the back of her neck.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> On your back. I hadn’t noticed it before. The wings. Is that what the Muggles call a tattoo?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Oh. Yes. Well, it’s an Augurey.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> An Augurey?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Haven’t you met them in Care of Magical Creatures? They’re sinister-looking black birds that cry when rain’s coming. Wizards
  used to believe that the Augurey’s cry foretold death. When I was growing up my guardian kept one in a cage.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Your . . . guardian?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, now she has the Time-Turner she’s enjoying the game of this.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> She used to say it was crying because it could see I was going to come to a sticky end. She didn’t like me much. Euphemia
  Rowle . . . she only took me in for the gold.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Why would you want a tattoo of her bird, then?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> It reminds me that the future is mine to make.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Cool. I might get an Augurey tattoo.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The Rowles were pretty extreme Death Eaters.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A thousand thoughts whir inside <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s head.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Come on, let’s get destroying . . . Confringo? Stupefy? Bombarda? Which would you use?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Give it back. Give us back the Time-Turner.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius? What are you doing?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I don’t believe you ever were ill. Why didn’t you come to Hogwarts? Why are you here now?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I’m trying to bring my cousin back!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> They called you the Augurey. In — the other world — they called you the Augurey.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A slow smile grows on <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>’s face.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> The Augurey? I rather like that.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Delphi?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She’s too quick. Leveling her wand, she repels <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, and she is far stronger. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> tries to keep her back, but
  she quickly overpowers him.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Fulgari!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s arms are bound in vicious, luminous cords.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus. Run!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks around, bewildered. And then starts to run.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Fulgari!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> is propelled to the floor, his hands tied by the same brutal binding.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And that is the first spell I’ve had to use on you. I thought I’d have to use plenty more. But you’re far easier to control than Amos — children,
  particularly male children, are so naturally pliant, aren’t they? Now, let’s sort this mess out once and for all . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But why? But what? But who are you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Albus. I am the new past.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s wand from him and snaps it.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">I am the new future.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s wand from him and snaps it.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">I am the answer this world has been looking for.</p></body></html>
