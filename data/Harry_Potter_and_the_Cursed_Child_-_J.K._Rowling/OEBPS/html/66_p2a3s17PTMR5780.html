The fact that in some realities we aren’t even, you know, married.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ron, whatever this is, I’ve got ten minutes until the goblins show up to talk security at Gringotts —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> I mean, we’ve been together so long — and married for so long — I mean, <em>so</em> long —</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I’ve read about. Marriage renewal. What do you
  think?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> <em>(melting slightly)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You want to marry me again?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and — well, to be honest, I can’t remember much of it
  and . . . The truth is — I love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says — I’d like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again.
  Sober.</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em>She looks at him, she smiles, she pulls him to her, she kisses him.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> You’re sweet.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> And you taste of toffee . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> laughs. <span class="sc">HARRY</span>, <span class="sc">GINNY</span>, and <span class="sc">DRACO</span> walk in on them as they move to
  kiss again. They spring apart.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Harry, Ginny, and — I, uh — Draco — how lovely to see you —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> The dreams. They’ve started again, well, they haven’t stopped.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> And Albus is missing. Again.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Scorpius too. We’ve had McGonagall check the entire school. They’re gone.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’ll get the Aurors summoned immediately, I’ll —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> No, you won’t, it’s all fine. Albus — I saw him last night. It’s all good.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Where?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>They all turn to look at <span class="sc">RON</span>, he’s briefly disconcerted but batters on.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> I was having a couple of firewhiskies with Neville in Hogsmeade — as you do — setting the world to rights — as we do — and
  we were coming back — quite late, very late, and trying to work out which Floo I could use because when you’ve had a drink sometimes you don’t want to use the tight ones —
  or the turny ones or —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Ron, if you could get to the point before we all strangle you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> He hasn’t run away — he’s having a quiet moment — he’s got himself an older girlfriend —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> An older girlfriend?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> And a cracking one at that — gorgeous silver hair. Saw them on the roof together, near the Owlery with Scorpius playing the gooseberry. Nice
  to see my love potion being used well, I thought.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> has a thought.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Her hair — was it silver and blue?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> That’s it — silver, blue — yup.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He’s talking about Delphi Diggory. Niece of — Amos Diggory.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> This is about Cedric again?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> says nothing, thinking fast. <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> looks around the room, concerned, and then shouts out of the door.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Ethel! Cancel the goblins.</p></body></html>
