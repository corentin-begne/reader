Where there was discomfort and insecurity, now there’s just power.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What are we doing on the Quidditch pitch?</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> says nothing.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The Triwizard Tournament. The third task. The maze. This is where the maze was. We’re going back for Cedric.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Yes, it is time to spare the spare once and for all. We will go back for Cedric and in doing so we will resurrect the world you saw,
  Scorpius . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Hell. You want to resurrect hell?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I want a return to pure and strong magic. I want to rebirth the Dark.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You want Voldemort’s return?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> The one true ruler of the wizarding world. He will return. Now, you’ve ensured the first two tasks are a little clogged up with magic
  — there are at least two visits from the future in both of them and I will not risk being revealed or distracted. The third task is clean, so let’s start there, shall we?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We won’t stop him — whatever you force us to do — we know he needs to win the tournament with my dad.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I don’t just want you to stop him. I want you to humiliate him. He needs to fly out of that maze naked on a broomstick made of purple
  feather dusters. Humiliation got you there before and it’ll get us there again. And the prophecy will be fulfilled.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Wasn’t aware that there was a prophecy, what prophecy?</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You have seen the world as it should be, Scorpius, and today we’re going to ensure its return.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We won’t. We won’t obey you. Whoever you are. Whatever you want us to do.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Of course you will.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You’ll have to use Imperio. You’ll have to control me.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> No. To fulfill the prophecy, this has to be you, not a puppet of you. You have to be the one to humiliate Cedric, so Imperio just won’t
  do — I’ll have to force you by other means.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>She takes out her wand. She points it at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>, who sticks his chin out.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Do your worst.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> looks at him. And then turns her wand on <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I will.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Yes, as I thought — this seems to frighten you more.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, whatever she does to me — we can’t let her —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Crucio!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> yells out in pain.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I will . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> <em>(laughing)</em><span class="sc">:</span> What? What on earth do you think you can do? A wizardwide disappointment? A sore on your family name?
  A spare? You want to stop me hurting your only friend? Then do what you’re told.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>, his eyes stay resistant.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">No? Crucio!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Stop. Please.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CRAIG</span> runs in, full of energy.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CRAIG BOWKER JR.:</span> Scorpius? Albus? Everyone’s looking for you —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Craig. Get away. Get help!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CRAIG BOWKER JR.:</span> What’s happening?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Avada Kedavra!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> sends a blast of green light across the stage — <span class="sc">CRAIG</span> is propelled backwards by it — and is immediately
  killed.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a silence. A silence that seems to last for a long time.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Did you not understand? These are not childish games we are playing here. You are useful to me, your friends are not.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> look at <span class="sc">CRAIG</span>’s body — their minds in hell.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">It took me a long time to discover your weakness, Albus Potter. I thought it was pride, I thought it was the need to impress your father, but then I realized your weakness was
  the same as your father’s: friendship. You will do exactly as you’re told, otherwise Scorpius will die, just like that <em>spare</em> did.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She looks at them both.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Voldemort will return and the Augurey will sit at his side. Just as it was prophesized. “When spares are spared, when time is turned, when unseen children murder their
  fathers: Then will the Dark Lord return.”</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She smiles. She pulls <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> viciously towards her.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Cedric is the spare, and Albus —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She pulls <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> viciously towards her.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">— the unseen child who will kill his father by rewriting time and so return the Dark Lord.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The Time-Turner starts rotating. She pulls their hands to it.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Now!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And there is a giant whoosh of light. A smash of noise.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And time stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards, slow at first . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then it speeds up.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then there’s a sucking noise. And a BANG.</em></p></body></html>
