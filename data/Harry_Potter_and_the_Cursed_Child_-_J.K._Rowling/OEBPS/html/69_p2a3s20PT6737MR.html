Behind her she drags <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>
  and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>. Their arms bound, their legs reluctantly moving.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> Ladies and gentlemen — boys and girls — I give you — the greatest — the fabulous — the one — and the
  only TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer. <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> turns left.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">If you’re from Hogwarts. Give me a cheer.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">If you’re from Durmstrang — give me a cheer.</p>       <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a loud cheer.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">AND IF YOU’RE FROM BEAUXBATONS GIVE ME A CHEER.</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a fulsome cheer.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> and the boys are forced to move as a hedge closes upon them.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak2">The French, finally showing us what they’re capable of there. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you — the final of the Triwizard tasks. A maze of mysteries, a disease
  of uncontrollable darkness, for this maze — it lives. It lives.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">VIKTOR KRUM</span> passes across the stage, moving through the maze.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak2">And why risk this living nightmare? Because inside this maze is a Cup — and not just any Cup — yes, the Triwizard trophy stands within this vegetation.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Where is he? Where is Cedric?</p>         <p class="textbreak2"><em>A hedge almost dissects <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The hedges want to kill us too? This gets better and better.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You will keep up or face the consequences.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> The perils are plentiful, but the prizes are palpable. Who will fight their way through? Who will fall at the final hurdle? What heroes do
  we have within our midst? Only time will tell, ladies and gentlemen, only time will tell.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em>They move through the maze, <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> being compelled by <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>. As she moves ahead, the
  boys have a chance to talk.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, we need to do something.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know, but what? She has snapped our wands, we’re bound, and she’s threatening to kill you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I’m ready to die if it’ll stop Voldemort returning.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Are you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You won’t have to mourn me for long, she’ll kill me and quickly kill you too.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(desperate)</em><span class="sc">:</span> The flaw in the Time-Turner, the five-minute rule. We do all we can to run down the clock.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> It won’t work.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>As another hedge changes direction, <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> pulls <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> in after her. They continue
  through this maze of despair.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">LUDO BAGMAN:</span> Now let me remind you of the current standings! Tied in first place — Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter. In second place
  — Mr. Viktor Krum! And in third place — <em>sacré bleu</em>, Miss Fleur Delacour.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Suddenly, <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> emerge from behind a hedge, they’re running.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Where did she go?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Does it matter? Which way do you think?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> rises up after them. She’s flying, and without a broom.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You poor creatures.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She throws the boys to the ground.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Thinking you can escape me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(astonished)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You’re not — even on a broom.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Brooms — such unwieldy, unnecessary objects. Three minutes gone. We have two minutes left. And you will do what you’re told.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. We won’t.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You think you can fight me?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. But we can defy you. If we lay down our lives to do so.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> The prophecy must be fulfilled. We will fulfill it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Prophecies can be broken.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You’re mistaken, child, prophecies are the future.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But if the prophecy is inevitable why are we here trying to influence it? Your actions contradict your thoughts — you’re dragging
  us through this maze because you believe this prophecy needs to be enabled — and by that logic prophecies can also be broken — prevented.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> You talk too much, child. Crucio!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> is racked with pain.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You wanted a test, Albus, this is it, and we’re going to pass it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>, finally aware what he has to do. He nods.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Then you will die.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(full of strength)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Yes. We will. And we’ll do so gladly knowing it’s stopped you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> rises up — full of fury.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> We don’t have time for this. Cru —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">MYSTERIOUS VOICE:</span> Expelliarmus!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Bang. <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>’s wand is pulled away from her. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks on in astonishment.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Brachiabindo!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> is bound. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> then turn as one and stare in astonishment at where the bolt
  came from: a young, good-looking lad of seventeen or so, <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> Come no further.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But you’re . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> Cedric Diggory. I heard screaming, I had to come. Name yourselves, beasts. I can fight you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> wheels around, astonished.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Cedric?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You saved us.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> Are you also a task? An obstacle? Speak. Do I have to defeat you too?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a silence.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. You just have to free us. That’s the task.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> thinks, trying to work out whether it’s a trap, and then waves his wand.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> Emancipare! Emancipare!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The boys are freed.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">And now I can go on? Finish the maze?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The boys look at <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> — they are heartbroken.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’m afraid you have to finish the maze.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> Then I shall.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> walks confidently away. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks after him — desperate to say something, unsure what to say.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Cedric —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> turns towards him.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Your dad loves you very much.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Behind them, <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>’s body creeps into movement. She crawls along the ground.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Just thought you should know that.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">CEDRIC:</span> Okay. Um. Thank you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">CEDRIC</span> looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> a moment more, and then walks on. <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> pulls out the Time-Turner from within
  her robes.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No. Wait . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> The Time-Turner is spinning . . . Look at what she’s doing . . . She can’t leave us behind.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> both scramble to grab part of the Time-Turner.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And there is a giant whoosh of light. A smash of noise.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And time stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards, slow at first . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And then it speeds up.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Albus . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What have we done?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> We had to go with the Time-Turner, we had to try to stop her.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Stop me? How do you think you’ve stopped me? I am done with this. You may have destroyed my chances of using Cedric to darken the world
  but maybe you’re right, Scorpius — maybe prophecies can be prevented, maybe prophecies can be broken. What is undoubtedly true is: I’m done with trying to use you annoying,
  incompetent creatures for anything. No more wasting precious seconds on either of you. Time to try something new.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She crushes the Time-Turner. It explodes in a thousand pieces.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> ascends again into the air. She laughs in delight as she sets off hard away.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The boys try to chase her, but they’ve not the slightest chance. She flies, they run.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No . . . No . . . You can’t . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> turns back and tries to pick up the Time-Turner pieces.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">The Time-Turner? It’s destroyed?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Utterly. We’re stuck here. In time. Wherever in time we are. Whatever it is she’s planning to do.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Hogwarts looks the same.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Yes. And we can’t be seen here. Let’s get out of here before we’re spotted.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We need to stop her, Scorpius.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I know we do — but how?</p></body></html>
