OSWALD’S HOME FOR OLD WITCHES AND WIZARDS, DELPHI’S ROOM</p> <p class="textfirst"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span>, <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span>, <span class="sc">RON</span>, <span class="sc">DRACO</span>, and <span class="sc">GINNY</span> look around a
  simple oak-paneled room.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It must have been a Confundus Charm she used on him. Used on them all. She faked being a nurse, she faked being his niece.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’ve just checked in with the Ministry — but there’s no record of her. She’s a shadow.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Specialis Revelio!</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>Everyone turns to look at <span class="sc">DRACO</span>.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">Well, it was worth a try, what are you waiting for? We know nothing, so we just have to hope this room reveals something.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Where can she have hidden anything? It’s quite a spartan room.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> These panels, these panels must conceal something.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Or the bed does.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DRACO</span> starts examining the bed, <span class="sc">GINNY</span> a lamp, as the rest start examining the wooden wall panels.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON</span> <em>(shouting as he hammers on the walls)</em><span class="sc">:</span> What you hiding? What you got?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Maybe we should all stop for a moment and have a think about what —</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> unscrews a chimney from an oil lamp. There’s a breathing-out noise. And then hissing words. They all turn towards it.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">What was that?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> That’s — I’m not supposed to be understanding — that’s Parseltongue.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And what does it say?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> How do I . . . ? I haven’t been able to understand Parseltongue since Voldemort died.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And nor has your scar hurt.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It says “Welcome, Augurey.” I think I need to tell it to open . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Then do it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> shuts his eyes.

A writhing mass of painted snakes emerges on all the walls.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And on them, written in fluorescent paint, a prophecy.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">What is this?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> “When spares are spared, when time is turned, when unseen children murder their fathers: Then will the Dark Lord return.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> A prophecy. A new prophecy.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Cedric — Cedric was called a spare.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> When time is turned — she has that Time-Turner, doesn’t she?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Their faces sink.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> She must do.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> But why does she need Scorpius or Albus?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Because I’m a parent — who hasn’t seen his child. Hasn’t understood his child.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Who is she? To be so obsessed with all this?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I think I’ve got the answer to that.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>They all turn to her. She points up . . . Their collective faces sink further and fill with fear.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Words are revealed on all the walls of the auditorium — dangerous words, horrible words.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">“I will rebirth the Dark.
