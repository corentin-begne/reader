She raises her hand for silence.
  Silence falls. She’s surprised at the lack of effort it took. She looks around herself.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Thank you. I’m so pleased so many of you were able to make my — second — Extraordinary General Meeting. I’ve got some
  things to say — I ask that we deal with questions — and there will be a lot of questions — after I speak.</p> <p class="textbreak2">As many of you know, a body has been found at Hogwarts. His name was Craig Bowker. He was a good boy. We have no firm information who was responsible for the act but yesterday
  we searched St. Oswald’s. A room there revealed two things — one, a prophecy that promised — the return of darkness — two, written on the ceiling, a proclamation —
  that the Dark Lord had a — that Voldemort had a child.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>The news reverberates around the room.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">We don’t know the full details. We’re only just investigating — questioning those with a Death Eater connection . . . And as yet no record has
  been found either of the child or of the prophecy — but, it does look like there’s some truth to it. This child was kept hidden from the wizarding world, and now she’s —
  well now she’s . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> She? A daughter? He had a daughter?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Yes. A daughter.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> And is she now in custody?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Professor, she did ask for no questions.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> It’s fine, Harry. No, Professor, that’s where this gets worse. I’m afraid we’ve no means of taking her into custody.
  Or indeed, stopping her doing anything. She’s out of our reach.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> We can’t — look for her?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We have good reason to believe — she’s hidden herself — in time.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> Of all the reckless stupid things, you kept the Time-Turner even now?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Professor, I assure you —</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> Shame on you, Hermione Granger.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> flinches in the face of the anger.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No, she doesn’t deserve that. You have a right to be angry. You all do. But this is not all Hermione’s fault. We don’t know
  how the witch got hold of the Time-Turner. Whether my son gave it to her.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Whether <em>our</em> son gave it her. Or whether it was stolen from him.</p>        <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> joins <span class="sc">HARRY</span> on the stage.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> Your solidarity is admirable, but it doesn’t make your negligence negligible.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Then it’s a negligence I too should face.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DRACO</span> walks up to the stage and stands beside <span class="sc">GINNY</span>. This is almost a Spartacus moment. There are gasps.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Hermione and Harry have done nothing wrong but try and protect us all. If they’re guilty then I am too.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> looks across at her cohort — moved. <span class="sc">RON</span> joins them on the stage.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Just to say — I didn’t know about much of it so can’t take responsibility — and I’m pretty sure my kids had nothing
  to do with it — but if this lot are standing up here then so am I.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> No one can know where they are — whether they’re together or apart. I trust that our sons will be doing all they can to stop her,
  but . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We haven’t given up. We’ve gone to the giants. The trolls. Everyone we can find. The Aurors are out flying, searching, talking to
  those who know secrets, following those who won’t reveal secrets.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> But there is one truth we can’t escape: That somewhere in our past a witch is trying to rewrite everything we ever knew — and all we
  can do is wait — wait for the moment she either succeeds or fails.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">PROFESSOR McGONAGALL:</span> And if she succeeds?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Then — just like that — most of the people in this room will be gone. We’ll no longer exist and Voldemort will rule again.</p></body></html>
