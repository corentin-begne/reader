Mr. Muggle. Question: Did you see a flying witch passing here? And by the way, what year is it? We just ran away
  from Hogwarts because we were frightened of upsetting things, but this is okay?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You know what annoys me most of all? Dad will think we did it deliberately.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus. Really? I mean, really really? We’re — trapped — lost — in time — probably permanently — and
  you’re worrying what your dad might think about it? I will never understand the two of you.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> There’s a lot to understand. Dad’s pretty complicated.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And you’re not? Not to question your taste in women, but you fancied . . . well . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>They both know who he’s talking about.</em></p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I did, didn’t I? I mean, what she did to Craig . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Let’s not think about that. Let’s focus on the fact that we have no wands, no brooms, no means of returning to our time. All we
  have is our wits and — no, that’s all, our wits — and we have to stop her.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">STATIONMASTER</span> <em>(in very strong Scots)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Ye ken th’ auld reekie train is running late, boys?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Sorry?</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">STATIONMASTER:</span> If you’re waiting oan th’ auld reekie train, you’ll need tae ken it’s running late.

Oh.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>’s face falls as he realizes.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The death of my grandparents. The attack on my dad as a baby . . . The moment when Voldemort’s curse rebounded on himself.

Delphi is trying to prevent that curse.
  She’s going to kill Harry herself. We need to get to Godric’s Hollow. Now.</p></body></html>
