I must be where the action is tonight?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> What are you doing?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Going through papers, seeing if I’ve missed anything I shouldn’t have. Marshaling forces to fight in the limited way we can fight.
  Knowing that the battle is being raged far away from us. What else can I do?</p>       <p class="textbreak2"><em>Pause. <span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE</span> says nothing.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">Where have you been, Dumbledore?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> I’m here now.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Here just as the battle is lost. Or are you denying that Voldemort is going to return.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> It is — possible.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Go. Leave. I don’t want you here, I don’t need you. You were absent every time it really counted. I fought him three times without
  you. I’ll face him again, if needs be — alone.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Harry, don’t you think I wanted to fight him on your behalf? I would have spared you if I could —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> “Love blinds us”? Do you even know what that means? Do you even know how bad that advice was? My son is — my son is fighting
  battles for us just as I had to for you. And I have proved as bad a father to him as you were to me. Leaving him in places he felt unloved — growing in him resentments he’ll take years
  to understand —</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> If you’re referring to Privet Drive, then —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Years — <em>years</em> I spent there alone, without knowing what I was, or why I was there, without knowing that anybody cared!</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> I — did not wish to become attached to you —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Protecting yourself, even then!</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> No. I was protecting you. I did not want to hurt you . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE</span> attempts to reach out of the portrait — but he can’t. He begins to cry but tries to hide it.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">But I had to meet you in the end . . . eleven years old, and you were so brave. So good. You walked uncomplainingly along the path that had been laid at your
  feet. Of course I loved you . . . and I knew that it would happen all over again . . . that where I loved, I would cause irreparable damage. I am no fit person to
  love . . . I have never loved without causing harm.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A beat.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You would have hurt me less if you had told me this then.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE</span> <em>(openly weeping now)</em><span class="sc">:</span> I was blind. That is what love does. I couldn’t see that you needed to hear that
  this closed-up, tricky, dangerous old man . . . loved you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A pause. The two men are overcome with emotion.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> It isn’t true that I never complained.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of
  magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You said that to me once before.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> It is all I have to offer you tonight.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He begins to walk away.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Don’t go!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> Those that we love never truly leave us, Harry. There are things that death cannot touch. Paint . . . and
  memory . . . and love.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I loved you too, Dumbledore.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DUMBLEDORE:</span> I know.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He is gone. And <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is alone. <span class="sc">DRACO</span> enters.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Did you know that in this other reality — the reality Scorpius saw into — I was Head of Magical Law Enforcement? Maybe this room
  will be mine soon enough. Are you okay?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> is consumed in his grief.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Come in — I’ll give you the tour.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DRACO</span> walks hesitantly inside the room. He looks around distastefully.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> The thing is, though — never really fancied being a Ministry man. Even as a child. My dad, it’s all he ever wanted — me,
  no.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> What did you want to do?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Quidditch. But I wasn’t good enough. Mainly I wanted to be happy.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> nods. <span class="sc">DRACO</span> looks at him a second more.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Sorry, I’m not very good at small talk, do you mind if we skip on to the serious business?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Of course. What — serious — business?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Beat.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Do you think Theodore Nott had the only Time-Turner?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> The Time-Turner the Ministry seized was a prototype. Made of inexpensive metal. It does the job — sure. But only being able to go back in
  time for five minutes — that’s a serious flaw — it isn’t something you’d sell to true collectors of Dark Magic.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> realizes what <span class="sc">DRACO</span> is saying.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He was working for you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> No. My father. He liked owning things that no one else had. The Ministry’s Time-Turners — thanks to Croaker — were always a
  little vanilla for him. He wanted the ability to go back further than an hour, he wanted the ability to travel back years. He’d never have used it. Secretly I think he preferred a world
  without Voldemort. But yes, the Time-Turner was built for him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And did you keep it?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DRACO</span> reveals the Time-Turner.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> No five-minute problem, and it gleams like gold, just the way the Malfoys like it. You’re smiling.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Hermione Granger. It was the reason she kept the first, the fear that there might be a second. Hanging on to this, you could have been sent to
  Azkaban.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Consider the alternative — consider if people had known that I had the ability to travel in time. Consider the rumor that would have been
  given increased — credence.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">DRACO</span>, understanding him perfectly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Scorpius.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> We were capable of having children but Astoria was frail. A blood malediction, a serious one. An ancestor was cursed . . . it
  showed up in her. You know how these things can resurface after generations . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’m sorry, Draco.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> I didn’t want to risk her health, I said it didn’t matter whether the Malfoy line died with me — whatever my father said. But
  Astoria — she didn’t want a baby for the Malfoy name, for pureblood or glory, but for us. Our child, Scorpius, was born . . . it was the best day of both our lives,
  although it weakened Astoria considerably. We hid ourselves away, the three of us. I wanted to conserve her strength . . . and so the rumors started.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I can’t imagine what that was like.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is
  exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I will always be suspected. There is no escaping the past. I never realized, though, that by hiding him away from this gossiping, judgmental world, I
  ensured that my son would emerge shrouded in worse suspicion than I ever endured.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We’ve been so busy trying to rewrite our own
  pasts, we’ve blighted their present.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Which is why you need this. I have been holding on to it, barely resisting using it, even though I would sell my soul for another minute with
  Astoria.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Oh, Draco . . . we can’t. We can’t use it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DRACO</span> looks up at <span class="sc">HARRY</span>, and for the first time — at the bottom of this dreadful pit — they look at each other
  as friends.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> We have to find them — if it takes centuries, we must find our sons —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> We have no idea where they are or when they are. Searching in time when you’ve no idea where in time to search, that’s a
  fool’s errand. No, love won’t do it and nor will a Time-Turner, I’m afraid. It’s up to our sons now — they’re the only ones who can save us.</p></body></html>
