And if I were you I’d be desperate to talk to her. But she needs to be able to beg Voldemort for
  Harry’s life, she needs to think he might die, and you’re the worst spoiler in the world that didn’t turn out to be true . . .</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dumbledore. Dumbledore’s alive. We get Dumbledore involved. We do what you did with Snape —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Can we risk him knowing your dad survives? That he has kids?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> He’s Dumbledore! He can cope with anything!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Albus, there have been about a hundred books written on what Dumbledore knew, how he knew it or why he did what he did. But what’s
  undoubtedly true — what he did — he needs to do — and I’m not going to risk messing with it. I was able to ask for help because I was in an alternate reality. We
  aren’t. We’re in the past. We can’t fix time only to create more problems — if our adventures have taught us anything, they’ve taught us that. The dangers of talking
  to anyone — infecting time — are too great.</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So we need to — talk to the future. We need to send Dad a message.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But we don’t have an owl that can fly through time. And he doesn’t have a Time-Turner.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We get a message to Dad, he’ll find a way to get back here. Even if he has to build a Time-Turner himself.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> We send a memory — like a Pensieve — stand over him and send a message, hope he reaches for the memory at exactly the right
  moment. I mean, it’s unlikely, but . . . Stand over the baby — and just repeatedly shout HELP. HELP. HELP. I mean, it might traumatize the baby slightly.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Only slightly.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> A bit of trauma now is nothing compared to what’s happening . . . and maybe when he then thinks — later — he
  might remember the faces of us as we — shouted —</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Help.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You’re right. It’s a terrible idea.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It’s one of your worst ideas ever.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Got it! We deliver it ourselves — we wait forty years — we deliver it —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Not a chance — once Delphi has set time the way she wants she’ll send armies to try and find us — kill us —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> So we hide in a hole?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> As pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next forty years . . . they’ll find us. And we’ll die
  and time will be stuck in the wrong position. No. We need something we can control, something we know he’ll get at exactly the right time. We need a —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> There’s nothing. Still, if I had to choose a companion to be at the return of eternal darkness with, I’d choose you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> No offense, but I’d choose someone massive and really good at magic.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">LILY</span> exits the house with <span class="sc">BABY HARRY</span> in a pram, she carefully puts a blanket on him.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">His blanket. She’s wrapping him in his blanket.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Well, it is a moderately cold day.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> He always said — it’s the only thing he had from her. Look at the love with which she’s put it on him — I think
  he’d like to know about that — I wish I could tell him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And I wish I could tell my dad — well, I’m not sure what. I think I’d like to tell him that I’m occasionally capable
  of more bravery than he might think I am.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> has a thought.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Scorpius — my dad still has that blanket.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That won’t work. If we write a message on it now, even really small, he’ll read it too soon. Time will be spoilt.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What do you know about love potions? What’s the ingredient they all contain?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Amongst other things, pearl dust.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Pearl dust is a relatively rare ingredient, isn’t it?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Mainly because it’s pretty expensive. What’s this about, Albus?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad and I had a fight on the day before I went to school.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> This I am aware of. I believe it kind of got us into this mess.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I threw the blanket across the room. It collided with the love potion that Uncle Ron gave me as a joke.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> He’s a funny guy.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> The potion spilt and the blanket was covered in it and I happen to know for a fact Mum hasn’t let Dad touch that room since I left it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> So?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So it’s coming up to Hallows’ Eve in their time as well as ours — and he told me he always finds that blanket, he needs to be
  with it on Hallows’ Eve — it was the last thing his mum gave him — so he will look for it and when he finds it . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No. Still not getting you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> What reacts with pearl dust?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Well, it is said that if tincture of Demiguise and pearl dust meet . . . they burn.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And is tincture of <em>(he’s unsure how to say the word)</em> Demiguise visible to the naked eye?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> No.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So if we were to get that blanket and write on it in tincture of Demiguise, then . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> <em>(eureka)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Nothing would react to it until it came into contact with the love potion. In your room. In the
  present. By Dumbledore, I love it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> We just need to work out where to find some . . . Demiguises.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> You know, rumor has it Bathilda Bagshot never saw the point in witches and wizards locking their doors.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The door swings open.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Rumor was right. Time to steal some wands and get potioning.</p></body></html>
