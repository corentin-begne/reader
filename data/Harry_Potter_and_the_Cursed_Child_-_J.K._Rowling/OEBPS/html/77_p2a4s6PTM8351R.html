She looks at him.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Surprised to find you here.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Don’t worry, I haven’t touched anything. Your shrine is preserved. <em>(He winces.)</em> Sorry. Bad choice of words.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> says nothing, <span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks up at her.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">You know I’ve had some pretty terrible Hallows’ Eves — but this is undoubtedly at least the — second worst.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I was wrong — to blame you. I always accuse you of jumping to things and it was me who — Albus went missing and I assumed it was
  your fault. I’m sorry I did that.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You don’t think this is my fault?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry, he was kidnapped by a powerful Dark witch, how can that be your fault?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I chased him away. I chased him to her.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Can we not treat this as if the battle is already lost?</p>   <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> nods. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> starts to cry.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’m sorry, Gin . . .</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Are you not listening to me? I’m sorry too.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I shouldn’t have survived — it was my destiny to die — even Dumbledore thought so — and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort.
  All these people — all these people — my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty — and it’s me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage — and it’s my fault.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> They were killed by Voldemort.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> But if I’d stopped him sooner? All that blood on my hands. And now our son has been taken too —</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> He’s not dead. Do you hear me, Harry? He’s not dead.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>She takes <span class="sc">HARRY</span> in her arms. There is a big pause filled with pure unhappiness.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> The Boy Who Lived. How many people have to die for the Boy Who Lived?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> sways a moment, unsure. Then he notices the blanket. He walks towards it.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">This blanket is all I have, you know . . . of that Hallows’ Eve. This is all I have to remember them. And whilst —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He picks up the blanket. He discovers it has holes in it. He looks at it, dismayed.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">This has got holes in it. Ron’s idiotic love potion has burnt through it, right through it. Look at this. It’s ruined. Ruined.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He opens up the blanket. He sees writing burnt through it. He’s surprised.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry, it has — something — written —</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>On another part of the stage, <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> and <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> appear.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> “Dad . . .”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> We’re starting with “Dad”?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So he’ll know it’s from me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Harry is his name. We should start with “Harry.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(firm)</em><span class="sc">:</span> We’re starting with “Dad.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> “Dad,” does it say, “Dad”? It’s not that distinct . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> “Dad, HELP.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> “Hello”? Does that say “Hello”? And then . . . “Good.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> “Dad Hello Good Hello”? No. This is . . . a strange joke.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> “Dad. Help. Godric’s Hollow.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Give me that. My eyesight is better than yours. Yes. “Dad Hello Good” — that’s not “Hello” again —
  that’s “Hallow” or “Hollow”? And then some numbers — these are clearer — “3 — 1 — 1 — 0 — 8 — 1.” Is this one of
  those Muggle telephone numbers? Or a grid reference or a . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks up, several thoughts smashing through his brain at once.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No. It’s a date. 31st October, 1981. The date my parents were killed.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> looks at <span class="sc">HARRY</span>, and then back at the blanket.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> That doesn’t say “Hello.” It says “Help.”</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> “Dad. Help. Godric’s Hollow. 31/10/81.” It’s a message. Clever boy left me a message.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> kisses <span class="sc">GINNY</span> hard.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Albus wrote this?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And he’s told me where they are and when they are and now we know where she is, we know where we can fight her.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He kisses her hard again.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> We haven’t got them back again yet.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’ll send an owl to Hermione. You send one to Draco. Tell them to meet us at Godric’s with the Time-Turner.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> And it is “us,” okay? Don’t even think about going back without me, Harry.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Of course you’re coming. We have a chance, Ginny, and by Dumbledore — that’s all that we need — a chance.</p></body></html>
