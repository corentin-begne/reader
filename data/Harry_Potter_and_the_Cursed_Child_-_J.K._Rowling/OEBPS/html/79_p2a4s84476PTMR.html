Time is of the essence. We need to get people into position. Now, Godric’s Hollow is not a large place but she
  could be coming from any direction. So we need somewhere that gives us good views of the town — that allows for multiple and clear observation points — and that will, most importantly,
  keep us hidden, because we cannot risk being seen.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>They all frown, thinking.</em></p>        <p class="textbreak2">I’d say St. Jerome’s Church ticks all those boxes, wouldn’t you?</p></body></html>
