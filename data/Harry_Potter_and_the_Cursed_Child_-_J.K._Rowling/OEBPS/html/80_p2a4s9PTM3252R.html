JEROME’S CHURCH, SANCTUARY, 1981</p> <p class="textfirst"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> is sleeping in a pew. <span class="sc">GINNY</span> watches him carefully. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> is looking out the opposite
  window.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No. Nothing. Why isn’t she here?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> We’re together, your mum and dad are alive — we can turn time, Harry, we can’t speed it up. She’ll come when she’s
  ready, and we’ll be ready for her.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>She looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>’s sleeping form.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">Or some of us will be.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Poor kid thought he had to save the world.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Poor kid has saved the world. That blanket was masterful. I mean, he also almost destroyed the world, but probably best not to focus on that
  bit.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You think he’s okay?</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> He’s getting there, it just might take him a bit of time — and you a bit of time too.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> smiles. She looks back at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> does too.</em></p>   <p class="textbreak2">You know, after I’d opened the Chamber of Secrets — after Voldemort had bewitched me with that terrible diary and I’d almost destroyed everything —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I remember.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> After I came out of hospital — everyone ignored me, shut me out — other than, that is, the boy who had everything — who came
  across the Gryffindor common room and challenged me to a game of Exploding Snap. People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are — have always been —
  heroic in really quiet ways. My point is — after this is over, just remember if you could that sometimes people — but particularly children — just want someone to play Exploding
  Snap with.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You think that’s what we’re missing — Exploding Snap?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> No. But the love I felt from you that day — I’m not sure Albus feels that.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’d do anything for him.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Harry, you’d do anything for anybody. You were pretty happy to sacrifice yourself for the world. He needs to feel specific love.
  It’ll make him stronger, and you stronger too.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You know, it wasn’t until we thought Albus had gone that I truly understood what my mother was able to do for me. A countercharm so
  powerful that it was able to repel the spell of death.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> And the only spell Voldemort couldn’t understand — love.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I do love him specifically, Ginny.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> I know, but he needs to feel it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’m lucky to have you, aren’t I?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Extremely. And I’d be delighted to discuss just how lucky at another time. But for now — let’s focus on stopping Delphi.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> We are running out of time.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>A thought occurs to <span class="sc">GINNY</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Unless — Harry, has anyone thought — why has she picked now? Today?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Because this is the day that everything changed . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Right now you’re over a year old, am I right?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> A year and three months.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> That’s a year and three months she could have killed you in. Even now, she’s been in Godric’s Hollow for twenty-four hours.
  What’s she waiting for?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’m still not entirely following —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> What if she’s not waiting for you — she’s waiting for him . . . to stop him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> Delphi’s picked tonight because he’s here — because her father is coming. She wants to meet him. Be with him, the father she
  loves. Voldemort’s problems started when he attacked you. If he hadn’t done that . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> He’d have only got more powerful — the darkness would only have got darker.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> The best way to break the prophecy is not to kill Harry Potter, it’s to stop Voldemort doing anything at all.</p></body></html>
