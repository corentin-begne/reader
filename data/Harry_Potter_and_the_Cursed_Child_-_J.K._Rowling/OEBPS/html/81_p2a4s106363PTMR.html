JEROME’S CHURCH, 1981</p> <p class="textfirst"><em>The group are gathered and full of confusion.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> So let me get this right — we’re fighting to protect Voldemort?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Voldemort killing my grandparents. Voldemort trying to kill my dad?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Of course, Ginny. Delphi’s not trying to kill Harry — she’s stopping Voldemort trying to kill Harry. Brilliant.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> So — we just wait? Until Voldemort turns up?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Does she know when he does turn up? Hasn’t she come here twenty-four hours early because she isn’t sure when he’ll arrive and
  in what direction? The history books — correct me if I’m wrong, Scorpius — show nothing about when and how he arrived in Godric’s Hollow?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">HERMIONE</span>: You’re not wrong.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Blimey! There are two of them!</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> So how can we use this to our advantage?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Do you know what I’m really good at?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> There’s plenty you’re good at, Albus.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Polyjuicing. And I think Bathilda Bagshot may have all the ingredients for Polyjuice in her basement. We can Polyjuice into Voldemort and bring
  her to us.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> To use Polyjuice you need a bit of someone. We don’t have a bit of Voldemort.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> But I like the concept, a pretend mouse for her cat.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> How close can we get through Transfiguration?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We know what he looks like. We’ve got some excellent wizards and witches here.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> You want to transfigure into Voldemort?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> It’s the only way.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> It is, isn’t it?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">RON</span> steps forward bravely.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Then I would like to — I think I should be him. I mean, it won’t be — exactly nice being Voldemort — but without wishing
  to blow my own trumpet — I am probably the most chilled out of all of us and . . . so maybe transfiguring into him — into the Dark Lord — will do less damage to me
  than — any of you more — intense — people.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> steps away, introspective.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Who are you calling intense?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> I’d also like to volunteer. I think being Voldemort requires precision — no offense, Ron — and a knowledge of Dark Magic and
  —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> And I’d like to volunteer too. As Minister for Magic I think it’s my responsibility and right.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Maybe we should draw lots —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> You’re not volunteering, Scorpius.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Actually —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> No, no way. I think you’re all mad. I know what that voice is like inside your head — I won’t have it in mine again
  —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And anyway — it has to be me.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Everyone turns to <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> What?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> For this plan to work she has to believe it’s him, without hesitation. She’ll use Parseltongue — and I <em>knew</em> there was a
  reason why I still have that ability. But more than that, I — know what it is to feel — like him. I know what it is to <em>be</em> him. It has to be me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Rubbish. Beautifully put but beautiful rubbish. No way are you going to —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> I’m afraid you’re right, my old friend.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Hermione, you’re wrong, Voldemort is not something to be — Harry should not —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> And I hate to agree with my brother, but —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> He could get stuck — as Voldemort — forever.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> So could any of us. Your concerns are valid, but . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Hang on, Hermione. Gin.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> and <span class="sc">HARRY</span> make eye contact.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">I won’t do it if you don’t want me to. But it feels like the only way to me, am I wrong?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> thinks a moment and then softly nods. <span class="sc">HARRY</span>’s face hardens.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> You’re right.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Then let’s do this.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Don’t we need to discuss the route you’re taking — the —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> She’s watching for him — she’ll come to me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> And then what? When she’s with you. May I remind you this is a very powerful witch.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Easy. He gets her in here. We zap her together.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> “Zap her”?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HERMIONE</span> looks around the room.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We’ll hide behind these doors. If you can get her to this point, Harry <em>(she indicates the point where the light from the rose window
  hits the floor)</em>, then we come out and make sure she has no chance to escape.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON</span> <em>(with a look to <span class="sc">DRACO</span>)</em><span class="sc">:</span> And then we’ll <em>zap</em> her.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Harry, last chance, are you sure you can do this?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Yes, I can do this.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> No, there’s too many what-ifs — too many things that can go wrong — the Transfiguration could not hold, she could see through
  it — if she escapes us now there’s no telling the damage she can do — we need time to properly plan, to —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Draco, trust my dad. He won’t let us down.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> — moved.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Wands.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Everyone withdraws their wands. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> clasps his.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There’s a light that builds — that overwhelms . . .</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The Transfiguration is slow and monstrous.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And the form of <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span> emerges from <span class="sc">HARRY</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And it’s horrendous.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He turns.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks around at his friends and family.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>They look back — aghast.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Bloody hell.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> It worked, then?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY</span> <em>(gravely)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Yes.
