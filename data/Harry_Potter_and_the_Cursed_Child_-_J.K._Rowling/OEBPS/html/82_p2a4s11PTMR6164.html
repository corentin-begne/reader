  the window, looking out. <span class="sc">GINNY</span> can’t look. She sits further back.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak3"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> notices his mum sitting apart.

Or I hope I do. I just — don’t want to see him like that. The man I love shrouded in the man I hate.</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> sits beside his mum.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I liked her, Mum, you know that? I really liked her. Delphi. And she was — Voldemort’s daughter?</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> That’s what they’re good at, Albus — catching innocents in their web.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> This is all my fault.</p>  <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">GINNY</span> takes <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> in her arms.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> How funny. Your dad seems to think it’s all his. Strange pair that you are.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> That’s her. That’s her. She’s seen him.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Positions. Everybody. And remember, don’t come out until he’s got her in the light — we’ve one shot at this, we
  don’t want to mess it up.</p>     <p class="textbreak2"><em>They all move fast.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DRACO:</span> Hermione Granger, I’m being bossed around by Hermione Granger. <em>(She turns towards him. He smiles.)</em> And I’m mildly enjoying
  it.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Dad . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>They scatter. They hide behind two major doors.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> reenters the church.

She is compelled to him. This is her father and this is the moment she’s waited for her entire life.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Lord Voldemort. It is me. I am following you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> I do not know you. Leave me.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She breathes deeply.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I am your daughter.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> If you were my daughter, I’d know of you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> looks at him imploringly.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I am from the future. The child of Bellatrix Lestrange and you. I was born in Malfoy Manor before the Battle of Hogwarts. A battle you are
  going to lose. I have come to save you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> turns. She meets his eyes.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">It was Rodolphus Lestrange, Bellatrix’s loyal husband, who on return from Azkaban told me who I was and revealed the prophecy he thought I was destined to fulfill. I am
  your daughter, sir.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> I am familiar with Bellatrix and there are certain similarities in your face — though you haven’t inherited the best of
  her. But without proof . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> speaks intently in Parseltongue.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> laughs viciously.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">That’s your proof?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> effortlessly rises into the air. <span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> steps back — amazed.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I am the Augurey to your Dark Lord, and I am ready to give all that I have to serve you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> <em>(trying not to show his shock)</em><span class="sc">:</span> You learnt — flight — from — me?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I have tried to follow the path you set.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> I have never met a witch or a wizard who’s attempted to be my equal before.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Do not mistake — I would not claim to be worthy of you, Lord. But I have devoted my life to being a child you could be proud of.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> <em>(interrupting)</em><span class="sc">:</span> I see what you are, and I see what you could be. Daughter.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She looks at him, desperately moved.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Father?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> Together, the power we could wield.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Father . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> Come here, in the light, so I may examine what my blood made.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Your mission is a mistake. Attacking Harry Potter is a mistake. He will destroy you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span>’s hand turns into <span class="sc">HARRY</span>’s hand. He looks at it, astonished and dismayed, and then quickly pulls
  it inside his sleeve.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> He is a baby.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> He has his mother’s love. Your spell will rebound, destroying you and making him too powerful and you too weak. You will recover to spend
  the next seventeen years consumed in a battle with him — a battle you will lose.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span>’s hair begins to sprout, he feels it, he attempts to cover it. He pulls his hood over his head.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT:</span> Then I won’t attack him. You are right.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Father?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY/VOLDEMORT</span> shrinks down — he is now more <span class="sc">HARRY</span> than <span class="sc">VOLDEMORT</span>. He turns his back to
  <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Father?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(trying desperately to still sound like Voldemort)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Your plan is a good one. The fight is off. You have served me
  well, now come here into the light so I may examine you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> sees a door slightly sway open and then be pulled shut. She frowns at it, thinking rapidly, her suspicion growing.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Father . . .</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She tries to get a glimpse of his face again — there is almost a dance happening here.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">You are not Lord Voldemort.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">DELPHI</span> unleashes a bolt from her hand. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> matches her.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Incendio!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Incendio!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The bolts meet in a beautiful explosion in the middle of the room.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>And with her other hand <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> sends bolts to both doors as they try to open them.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Potter. Colloportus!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> looks at the doors, dismayed.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">What?

Harry . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY</span> <em>(from off)</em><span class="sc">:</span> She’s sealed the doors from your side.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Fine. I’ll deal with you alone.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He moves to attack her again. But she is far stronger. <span class="sc">HARRY</span>’s wand ascends upwards towards her. He is disarmed. He is helpless.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">How did you . . . ? What are you?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I’ve watched you for a long time, Harry Potter. I know you better than my father did.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You think you’ve learnt my weaknesses?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> I’ve studied to be worthy of him! Yes, even though he is the supreme wizard of all time, he will be proud of me. Expulso!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> rolls away as the floor explodes behind him. He crawls frantically under a church pew, trying to work out how he can fight her.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Are you crawling away from me? Harry Potter. Hero of the wizarding world. Crawling away like a rat. Wingardium Leviosa!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The church pew ascends into the air.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">The question is whether it’s worth my time to kill you — knowing that as soon as I stop my father your destruction will be assured. How to decide? Oh, I’m
  bored, I’ll kill you.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She sends the pew down hard upon him. It smashes as he rolls desperately away.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> emerges from a grate on the floor. Neither notice.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">Avada —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Albus! No!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Two of you? Choices, choices. I think I’ll kill the boy first. Avada Kedavra!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She fires the Killing Curse at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> — but <span class="sc">HARRY</span> throws him out of the way. The bolt smashes into the ground.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He fires a bolt back.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">You think you’re stronger than me?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> No. I’m not.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>They fire bolts mercilessly at each other as <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> rolls quickly away and slams a spell into one door and then another.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">But we are.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> opens both doors with his wand.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Alohomora! Alohomora!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I’ve never fought alone, you see.

  spells at <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>, who screams out in exasperation. This is titanic. But she can’t fight them all.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em>There are a series of bangs — and then, overwhelmed, <span class="sc">DELPHI</span> tumbles to the floor.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> No . . . No . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> Brachiabindo!</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She’s bound.</em></p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> advances towards <span class="sc">DELPHI</span>.

I need to know he’s safe . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">GINNY:</span> He insisted. He was the only one small enough to crawl through the grate. I tried to stop him.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Just tell me he’s okay.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’m fine, Dad.

Albus, she’s a murderer, and we’re not.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HERMIONE:</span> We have to be better than them.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">RON:</span> Yeah, it’s annoying but it’s what we learnt.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">DELPHI:</span> Take my mind.
