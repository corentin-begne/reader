They slam the door after themselves.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I can’t quite believe I did that.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I can’t quite believe you did that either.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Rose Granger-Weasley. I asked out Rose Granger-Weasley.</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And she said no.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> But I asked her. I planted the acorn. The acorn that will grow into our eventual marriage.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You are aware that you’re an utter fantasist.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And I’d agree with you — only Polly Chapman did ask me to the school ball . . .</p>  <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> In an alternate reality where you were significantly — really significantly more popular — a different girl asked you out —
  and that means —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And yes, logic would dictate I should be pursuing Polly — or allowing her to pursue me — she’s a notorious beauty, after
  all — but a Rose is a Rose.</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You know logic would dictate that you’re a freak? Rose hates you.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Correction, she used to hate me, but did you see the look in her eyes when I asked? That wasn’t hate, that was pity.</p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And pity’s good?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Pity is a start, my friend, a foundation on which to build a palace — a palace of love.</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I honestly thought I’d be the first of us to get a girlfriend.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Oh, you will, undoubtedly, probably that new smoky-eyed Potions professor — she’s old enough for you, right?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I don’t have a thing about older women!</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> And you’ve got time — a lot of time — to seduce her. Because Rose is going to take years to persuade.</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I admire your confidence.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ROSE</span> comes past them on the stairs. She looks at them both.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Hi.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>Neither boy knows quite how to reply — she looks at <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">This is only going to be weird if you let it be weird.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Received and entirely understood.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ROSE:</span> Okay. “Scorpion King.”</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>She walks off with a smile on her face. <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> and <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> look at each other. <span class="sc">ALBUS</span> grins and
  punches <span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> on the arm.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Maybe you’re right — pity is a start.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Are you heading to Quidditch? Slytherin are playing Hufflepuff — it’s a big one —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I thought we hated Quidditch?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> People can change. Besides, I’ve been practicing. I think I might make the team eventually. Come on.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I can’t. My dad’s arranged to come up —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> He’s taking time away from the Ministry?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> He wants to go on a walk — something to show me — share with me — something.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> A walk?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I know, I think it’s a bonding thing or something similarly vomit-inducing. Still, you know, I think I’ll go.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">SCORPIUS</span> reaches in and hugs <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak2">What’s this? I thought we decided we don’t hug.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> I wasn’t sure. Whether we should. In this new version of us — I had in my head.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Better ask Rose if it’s the right thing to do.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">SCORPIUS:</span> Ha! Yeah. Right.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>The two boys dislocate and grin at each other.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I’ll see you at dinner.</p></body></html>
