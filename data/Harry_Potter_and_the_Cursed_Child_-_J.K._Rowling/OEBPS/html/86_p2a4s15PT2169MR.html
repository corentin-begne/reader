They say nothing, enjoying the sun on their faces as they
  climb.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> So are you ready?</p> <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> For what?</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Well, there’s the fourth-year exams — and then the fifth year — big year — in my fifth year I did —</p> <p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>. He smiles. He talks quickly.</em></p>    <p class="textbreak2">I did a lot of stuff. Some of it good. Some of it bad. A lot of it quite confusing.</p>       <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Good to know.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> smiles.</em></p>  <p class="textbreak2">I got to watch them — you know — for a bit — your mum and dad. They were — you had fun together. Your dad used to love to do this smoke ring thing with
  you where you . . . well, you couldn’t stop giggling.</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Yes?</p>   <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I think you’d have liked them. And I think me, Lily, and James would have liked them too.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> nods. There’s a slightly uncomfortable silence. Both are trying to reach each other here, both are failing.</em></p>     <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You know, I thought I’d lost him — Voldemort — I thought I’d lost him — and then my scar started hurting again and
  I had dreams of him and I could even speak Parseltongue again and I started to feel like I’d not changed at all — that he’d never let me go —</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And had he?</p>         <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> The part of me that was Voldemort died a long time ago, but it wasn’t enough to be physically rid of him — I had to be mentally rid
  of him. And that — is a lot to learn for a forty-year-old man.</p>    <p class="textbreak2"><em>He looks at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p> <p class="textbreak2">That thing I said to you — it was unforgivable, and I can’t ask you to forget it but I can hope we move past it. I’m going to try to be a better dad for you,
  Albus. I am going to try and—be honest with you and . . .</p>    <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad, you don’t need to —</p>        <p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You told me you don’t think I’m scared of anything, and that — I mean, I’m scared of everything. I mean, I’m
  afraid of the dark, did you know that?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Harry Potter is afraid of the dark?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I don’t like small spaces and — I’ve never told anyone this, but I don’t much like — <em>(he hesitates before
  saying it)</em> pigeons.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> You don’t like pigeons?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY</span> <em>(he scrunches up his face)</em><span class="sc">:</span> Nasty, pecky, dirty things. They give me the creeps.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But pigeons are harmless!</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I know. But the thing that scares me most, Albus Severus Potter, is being a dad to you. Because I’m operating without wires here. Most
  people at least have a dad to base themselves on — and either try to be or try not to be. I’ve got nothing — or very little. So I’m learning, okay? And I’m going to
  try with everything I’ve got — to be a good dad for you.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> And I’ll try and be a better son. I know I’m not James, Dad, I’ll never be like you two —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> James is nothing like me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Isn’t he?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Everything comes easy for James. My childhood was a constant struggle.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> So was mine. So you’re saying — am I — like you?</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> smiles at <span class="sc">ALBUS</span>.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Actually you’re more like your mum — bold, fierce, funny — which I like — which I think makes you a pretty great
  son.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> I almost destroyed the world.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Delphi wasn’t going anywhere, Albus — you brought her out into the light and you found a way for us to fight her. You may not see it
  now, but you saved us.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But shouldn’t I have done better?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You don’t think I ask myself the same questions?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(stomach sinking further, he knows this is not what his dad would do)</em><span class="sc">:</span> And then — when we caught her —
  I wanted to kill her.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> You’d watched her murder Craig, you were angry, Albus, and that’s okay. And you wouldn’t have done it.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> How do you know that? Maybe that’s my Slytherin side. Maybe that’s what the Sorting Hat saw in me.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I don’t understand your head, Albus — actually, you know what, you’re a teenager, I shouldn’t be able to understand your
  head, but I do understand your heart. I didn’t — for a long time — but thanks to this — “escapade” — I know what you got in there. Slytherin, Gryffindor,
  whatever label you’ve been given — I know — <em>know</em> — that heart is a good one — yeah, whether you like it or not, you’re on your way to being some
  wizard.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Oh I’m not going to be a wizard, I’m going into pigeon racing. I’m quite excited about it.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">HARRY</span> grins.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> Those names you have — they shouldn’t be a burden. Albus Dumbledore had his trials too, you know — and Severus Snape, well,
  you know all about him —</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> They were good men.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what — those flaws almost made them greater.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> looks around himself.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad? Why are we here?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> This is where I often come.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> But this is a graveyard . . .</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> And here is Cedric’s grave.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Dad?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> The boy who was killed — Craig Bowker — how well did you know him?</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> Not well enough.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I didn’t know Cedric well enough either. He could have played Quidditch for England. Or been a brilliant Auror. He could have been
  anything. And Amos is right — he was stolen. So I come here. Just to say sorry. When I can.</p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS:</span> That’s a — good thing to do.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> joins his dad in front of <span class="sc">CEDRIC</span>’s grave. <span class="sc">HARRY</span> smiles at his son and looks up at the
  sky.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">HARRY:</span> I think it’s going to be a nice day.</p><p class="textbreak2"><em>He touches his son’s shoulder. And the two of them — just slightly — melt together.</em></p><p class="textbreak1"><span class="sc">ALBUS</span> <em>(smiles)</em><span class="sc">:</span> So do I.</p></body></html>
